# Install SuperOffice 9 or 10 Windows client

From SuperOffice 9 the SuperOffice Windows client is not available. The *SuperOffice9.exe* (or *SuperOffice10.exe* for SuperOffice 10) installer contains SuperOffice Admin client, Reporter Studio and Travel Gateway.

The installer is found on the SuperOffice CRM Server in the *Client* folder.

## Installer

All installation tasks are performed by the installer found in the folder *SuperOffice Server\Client*.

To install the client run the MSI Installer SuperOffice9.exe found in the *SuperOffice Server\Client* folder.

Note: If you want to use Oracle you need to install the Oracle client drivers on each client first. Oracle 10g may run on the Microsoft version of the Oracle driver.

It will default install to *C:\Program Files (x86)\SuperOffice*. The default location for SuperOffice temp (SoTemp) is Local.
