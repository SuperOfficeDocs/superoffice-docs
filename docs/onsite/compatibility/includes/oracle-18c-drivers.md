SuperOffice does not run on Oracle 18 ODBC drivers.

You may run Oracle 18 on the database server, but you need an older Oracle 12c ODBC driver on the SuperOffice client/server.

Our existing customers can upgrade their database servers to Oracle 18c, and as long as they do not upgrade the database drivers on the machines running SuperOffice it will continue to work.
