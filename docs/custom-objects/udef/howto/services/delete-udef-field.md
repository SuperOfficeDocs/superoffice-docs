How to write good how-to guides 

- Provide a series of steps​
- Focus on results​
- Solve a problem​
- Don’t explain concepts, link to them​
- Allow for some flexibility, point out more ways to do same thing​
- Leave things out – start and end where it seems appropriate​
- Bloated how-to guides don’t help the reader get speedy solution​
- Name them well
