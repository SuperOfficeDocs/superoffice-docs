# Request to publish

[!include[When to publish](../includes/ready-to-publish.md)]

![Request to publish in the Development Portal -screenshot][img1]

[!include[What needs approval for Stage and Production?](../includes/what-to-publish.md)]

In all three cases, after you click the **Request to Publish** button we create a support ticket and follow up with you via email. The workflow is different for standard and custom applications.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the version you want to publish, click **More versions**.
