As a partner that offers one or more applications through the [SuperOffice App Store][1], you need to create and maintain two sets of public information:

## Requirements

Before a new application gets listed in the App Store:

* Your standard application has [passed certification][5], including Watchcom's security evaluation.

**Required info:**

* Application description and images (see [marketing requirements][2])

**Relevant info:**

* Link to the product page for the application on your website
