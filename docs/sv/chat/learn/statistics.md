# Visa chattstatistik

The chat statistics can be used to improve the overall communication and agents' performance, as well as shorten the response time. You can view them in the **Dashboard** tab in the **Chat** screen.

![In the Chat Dashboard tab, you have a section showing the statistics of incoming chats -screenshot][img1]

In addition to general statistics about chat sessions, you can monitor the following:

* How many people are waiting for an agent to respond.
* How long they have waited.
* How many agents are available.
* How many chat sessions are active.

By default statistics are shown for all available channels, but you can select a specific chat channel from the **Channel** list.

## Create a dashboard for chat conversation

You can visualize statistics from chat conversations in a dashboard to get an informative overview of the data. After you [create a dashboard][2], you can add and edit tiles.

### Examples - tiles you can add to your dashboard for chat conversations

* Use the **Agent with the best average rating this month tile** to see which agent that on average performed best that month. The tile can be used for motivation, or for internal competition.

* The **Chat conversations per month** tile let you keep track of how many chats your company receives each month.

* By adding the **Most busy hour** tile, you can learn what hour of the day most customers contact your chat agents throughout the year. The tile can also be modified to show other time-frames.

* With the **My average chat rating this month** tile you can follow the average rating score you receive from your customers. Use it as an indicator of how satisfied your customers are with your service, and as a motivation to improve or to keep doing the great work.
