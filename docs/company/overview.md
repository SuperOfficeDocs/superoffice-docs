## Company vs. other entities

The company card uses the [contact][2] table and its related tables:

![Company tables diagram][img1]

There are multiple `person` records for any `contact`. A classic many-to-one relationship.

* A **person** can only belong to one **contact**.
* A **contact** can have zero or more **persons**.

It is this relationship that drives the first to fields in the appointment, sale, and document dialogs. Every time you select a new company, the person list below it has to be re-populated.

* [contact][10] (person table)
* [documents][11]
* [follow-ups][12] (appointment table)
* [projects][13]
* [sales][14]
