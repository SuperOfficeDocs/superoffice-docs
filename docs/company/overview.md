The company card uses the `contact` table and its related tables:

> [!NOTE]
> There are multiple person records for any contact. A classic many-to-one relationship.

* A `person` can only belong to one `contact`.
* A `contact` can have zero or more persons.

It is this relationship that drives the first to fields in the appointment, sale, and document dialogs. Every time you select a new company, the person list below it has to be re-populated.
