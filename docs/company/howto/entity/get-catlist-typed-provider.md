# Get a CategoryList through typed list providers

In the `SoList` class, there are specific methods to create different types of list providers. Hence there is a method specialized in creating `CategoryList` providers too.

The following example shows how to get a [category list][2] using [typed list providers][1].

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/get-catlist-typed.cs)]

By using the `CategoryList` method defined in the `SoList` class you can obtain a `CategoryList` provider.

There are 3 different items present in the `CategoryList` provider: HeadingItems, HistoryItems, and RootItems. Each of these items contains its own properties and in this example, we have used only the `Id` and the `Name` properties.

The `HistoryItems` are defined in the [history table][1] with its `table_Id` field referring to the conceptual table ID of the [category table][4]. Unless the MDO mode of the `Contact` list is turned on, no record will be added to the `history` table.

The `RootItems` are defined by the records in the `category` table only if the MDO mode is set to false. If the MDO mode is set to true then the `RootItems` contain only the items that have not been assigned to any Heading. Normally all the HeadingItems are taken directly from the [heading table][5].

**Output of the example:**
