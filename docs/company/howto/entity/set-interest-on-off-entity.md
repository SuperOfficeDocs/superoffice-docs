# How to set an interest on or off for a contact (data layer)

You can search for an [interest][1] and then set the interest to true or false. Here, we use the `ContactInterestHelper`.

## Code

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/toggle-interest-entity.cs)]

## Walk-through

The `Find` method available through the `Contact` classâ€™s `InterestHelper.RootItems` can be used to make our search.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/toggle-interest-entity.cs?range=14-18)]

The method returns an `ISoListItem` and requires a delegate that defines the element for which we should search to be passed into the method. The method then returns any interest that matches our search interest by using the `Equals` method.

Next, we move on to setting the interest to true or false. To do this we use the `SetItemSelection` method available `ContactInterestHelper` class. The method requires the interest ID and the new selection status (true or false) to be passed.
