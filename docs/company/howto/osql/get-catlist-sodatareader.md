# Get the CategoryList through SODataReader

[SODataReader][1] also facilitates us in obtaining category lists. Here you have to query the database to retrieve the `CategoryList`.

[!include[ALT](../../../api/includes/note-using-sodatareader.md)]

## Code

The following example demonstrates how it is done.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/get-catlist-osql.cs)]

## Walk-through

Here we make a query to retrieve the `CategoryList` from the [category database table][2]. If any category has a heading then there will be a link provided in the [categoryheadinglink table][3].

We have grouped items in the category list according to their headings. If any record in the `category` table doesnâ€™t have a heading then "0" will be returned as the `HeadingId`. Similarly, you can obtain the history items by querying the [history table][4].
