# Working with companies in CRMScript

## Company (class)

The [Company CRMScript class][1] represents the following entities:

* Real-life: a company or organization
* SuperOffice UI: company
* Database table: [contact][4]

The **company** database table is unrelated to the **Company** CRMScript class. The table should have one row only, containing information about licenses and the owner of the SuperOffice database.

[!include[Don't change company table](../../../includes/warn-company-table.md)]

## Parser variables

Calling `toParser()` will load the following fields and make them available to [templates][2]:

* company.id
* company.name
* company.note
* company.domain
* company.phone
* company.fax
* company.adr
* company.ourContact
* company.primaryContact.id
* company.primaryContact.email

See the [connected persons][5] table for a description of `ourContact` and `primaryContact`.

```crmscript!
Parser p;
Company c;
c.load(2);
c.toParser(p);
printLine(p.getVariable("company.name", 0));
```
