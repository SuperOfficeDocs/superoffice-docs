The current released add-on version (via the MS App Source) does not support Mobile phones (the mobile device API).

To get the version that has support for the mobile devices, use one of these options:

* option a: [centralized deployment][1]

* option b: [use the pilot version][4]

## Requirements for centralized deployment

Learn more about the requirements forÂ [Centralized Deployment][5] from Microsoft.

If an add-in update significantly increases the scope of data access, you must re-approve it before the update is deployed.
