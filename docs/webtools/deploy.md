# Web Tools deployment in a restricted environment

Currently, the best way of distributing Web Tools is by deploying the pre-requisites and allowing users to [install Web Tools themselves][4]. This method will utilize the built-in update functionality.

However, there are companies where users are not allowed to install software on their devices at all. Those companies need to deploy the pre-requisites and the MSI files using their preferred deployment strategy. Updates must be manually handled by the company and deployed through their solution.

If Web Tools are already installed, or if you for other reasons wish to configure it, it is possible to use **SoConfig** files for the initial setup:

When deploying through GPO or other alternatives, executing the *SoConfig* file during the log-on process will set up Web Tools for the user. The site will not be added again if it has already been added.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not the administrator, you get Web Tools installed in *c:\users\\\<yourname>\appdata\local\SuperOffice*. To install on *C:/Program files*, you need to be the local administrator.

## Overview

1. Extract required files from the Web Tools installer.
2. Distribute the MSI files (using GPO or SCCM tools) to all machines that are going to use WebTools.
3. Auto-configure the URL and Settings using a script.

The following MSI files must be deployed to every SuperOffice user (AD group all SuperOffice users):

* SoCrossTableInstaller.msi (component for viewing cross-table reports)
* SuperOffice.MailLink.Setup.msi (add-in for Microsoft Outlook)
* SuperOffice.Web.Extensions.msi (document-handling plugin for SuperOffice)

## Pre-requisites

* Username in SuperOffice must be the same as in ActiveDirectory (sAMAccountName).
* SuperOffice needs to be configured to use Active Directory as the authentication method for all users.
* SuperOffice WEB needs to be configured to use Windows Authentication on the website.
* We also recommend to [disable the Web Tools upgrade dialog][2].
* Blocking applications must be closed.
* Libraries must be installed **before any SuperOffice plugins are installed**.

**Required libraries:**

* Microsoft .NET framework 4.5.1 (Full) or higher
* VSTO 2010 runtime (32bit or 64bit) for Ribbons on Office 2007 and higher
* Visual C++ 2017 runtime for x86 (version 14.14.26429.4)

> [!NOTE]
> You need administrative privileges to install the required libraries.

## Blocking applications

There are several applications that need to be closed when MailLink and Web Extensions are being installed. Make sure all of these are switched off when you deploy Web Tools.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not run Outlook.exe as administrator (then you do not run it as "your own local user") and that will not work for MailLink.

**For MailLink, close:**

* Outlook
* SuperOffice CRM Win client
* SoEventServer

**For Web Extensions, close:**

* SuperOffice TrayApp Client

## Step 1: Extract required files from the Web Tools installer

You need to extract *SoCrossTableInstaller.msi*, *SuperOffice.MailLink.Setup.msi*, and *SuperOffice.Web.Extensions.msi*.

1. Download the Web Tools installer from the [Download Service][3] or from inside the SuperOffice Web **Download** menu.

2. Extract Mail Link and Web Extensions installers out of Web Tools installer:

    `SuperOffice.Web.Tools.exe /k /d C:\Temp`

3. Run `SuperOffice.MailLink.Setup.exe` but don't finish the installation. While keeping the installer on-screen:

    1. Go to the *%temp%* folder.
    2. Locate a folder where the installer unpacked the MailLink files.
    3. Copy the *SuperOffice.MailLink.Setup.msi* file out of it.

4. Run `SuperOffice.Web.Extensions.exe` as above to obtain *SuperOffice.Web.Extensions.msi*.

5. To get *SoCrossTableInstaller.msi*, download CrossTable viewer from inside the SuperOffice Web **Download** menu and follow the same procedure as with MailLink to get the MSI from the *%temp%* folder during CrossTable viewer installation.

> [!TIP]
> Because MailLink is a separate downloadable installer (the latest version) available on the Download Service, customers wishing to upgrade or extract MSI only MailLink can do so.

## Steps 2-3: Deploy and configure MSI files

1. Install all MSI packages with a help of the **InstallWebTools.cmd** script (see below). It also copies the **SuperOfficeWebToolConfiguration.cmd** script to the **Start** menu for all users and removes the default Web Extensions link.

2. Edit *SuperOfficeWebToolConfiguration.cmd* with correct settings:

    ```bat
    set SuperOfficeWebUrl=https://socrm.myorganization.com/sales
    set SuperOfficeServiceURL=https://socrm.myorganization.com/service
    set SuperOfficeOwnerContactName=Licence owner name
    ```

3. Restart the target computer.
