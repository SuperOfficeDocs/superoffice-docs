# How to display an image from the Blob table (data layer)

All pictures are stored in the `BinaryObject` table in the database. You can retrieve such information using `SoCore` and `SoDatabase` DLLs.

In the following example, we have displayed the Image description in ListBox. Based on the selection made by the user we would retrieve and display that image in a PictureBox.

## Display image list

Following is the code for retrieving and displaying the image list in the ListBox.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/displayimagelist-entity.cs)]

We have retrieved image-related information by using the `BinaryObjectRows` class. Since we are retrieving images that are of "image/jpeg", we have used the `GetFromIdxMimeType` method. By iterating on the retrieved row collection we have displayed the description of each image row in the list box.

## Display selected image

Once the user selects an item from the ListBox the following code segment will be executed. This is responsible for displaying the image.

Since we are retrieving `BinaryObjectRow` based on the image description, we need to create a `CustomSearch` first to select the user-selected row. The searchâ€™s restriction should be applied to the `MimeType` and `Description` columns like this:

Once we have defined the `CustomSearch`, we can use it with the `GetFromCustomSearch` method available in the `BinaryObjectRow` class. We use the `BinaryData` property of the `BinaryObjectRow` class to fill our image into the Stream and then display it using the following statement.
