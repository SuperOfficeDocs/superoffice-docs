# Person

For a better understanding of this section, we recommend that you read [SuperOffice view of the world][1].

It is important to keep in mind that there's not a 1:1 mapping of labels and that you have to take context into account.

* Real-life terms
* UI labels
* Database tables
* CRMScript classes

## Person picture and blobs

Pictures are stored in the BLOB table.

The Blobs are linked to other records in the system using the `BinaryLink` table.

Blobs are currently used for four things:

* Pictures on person records
* Pictures on project records
* Flags on country records
* Status monitor pictures

If you add a picture to a person, you must write the picture to the `BinaryObject` table, and then write the corresponding `BinaryObjectLink` to link the BLOB with the person record.

Without the link record, the picture will not appear.
