# Employees (internal)

The **associate** database table represents employees, resources, and other users - except for external persons.

Yet, this table is important for understanding and navigating the relationship between a person and their user account as well as the relationship between employees at the organization running the CRM system and the external parties they interact with.

You may think of associates as the missing link that connects people.

## Associate types

## Associate list and cache

In NetServer when you have a session, the session cache will contain a special cache entry named the **associate cache**. There all the associates listed in the SuperOffice database can be accessed through the cache, which is much faster than retrieving the associates from the database.

The **associate list** is an MDO list type that you can retrieve from the database. It holds all the associates from the SuperOffice database.
