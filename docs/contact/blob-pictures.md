# Person picture and BLOBs

Pictures are stored in the BLOB table. The BLOBs are linked to other records in the system using the [BinaryObjectLink table][2].

BLOBs are currently used for four things:

* Pictures on person records
* Pictures on project records
* Flags on country records
* Status monitor pictures

If you add a picture to a person, you must write the picture to the [BinaryObject table][1], and then write the corresponding `BinaryObjectLink` to link the BLOB with the person record.

Without the link record, the picture will not appear.

## Howto

* [Display image from BLOB table (entities)][4]
* [Get person image (REST)][5]
* [Update person image (REST)][6]
* [Display person image (ImageUtility)][7]
