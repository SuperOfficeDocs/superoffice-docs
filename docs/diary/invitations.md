# Invitations

When two appointments have a shared text record and different status values it can be called an invitation.

Invitations are **created** when calling meetings or other arrangements between different members of a company.

When we save the appointment, an invitation will also be added to the person we invited and will be shown in the diary of the person on the appropriate date and time. **This only happens if the invited person also is an associate.** You may invite persons belonging to other contacts as well, these will not have a diary where the appointment is shown, but it will be shown in the activity archive of their contact instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Resources and non-user persons don't receive invitations – the appointment is just created as a normal appointment for these participants.

When an invitation is **accepted** it will be displayed on the user’s diary.
