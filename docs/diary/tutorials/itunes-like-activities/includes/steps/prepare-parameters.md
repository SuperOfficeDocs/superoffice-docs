Section 1 in the code shows how the parameters required by the `GetArchiveListByColumns` method are created:

* the columns to be included in the selection
* the search restrictions
* the order in which the results should be sorted
* the entities to be included in the search

Next, an `ArchiveAgent` object is created. Then the `GetArchiveListByColumns` method is invoked to get the activity information.
