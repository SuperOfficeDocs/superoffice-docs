The non-XML format shown in the previous step is what Outlook, Google, and Apple's calendar can use to integrate external calendar events.

### Outlook

Outlook can load the iCal feed using the **internet calendar** account setting.

1. Under the TOOLS menu, open ACCOUNT SETTINGS. A dialog appears.

2. Go to the INTERNET CALENDARS tab and add a NEW calendar.

3. Outlook will download the appointments once you have pasted in the link to `ical.aspx?associd=123&guid=1234-4567…`

4. The calendar shows up in the calendar view in Outlook – you just need to mark the checkbox for the calendar you added.

### Google Calendar

So if you have a Google Phone, you can now get your SuperOffice calendar to show up on the phone. To do this we go via the Google Calendar web page.

1. Log in to the `http://calendar.google.com/` website.

2. Click on the ADD menu under OTHER CALENDARS: ADD BY URL

    A simple dialog box appears (similar to the one in Outlook)

3. Paste the ical.aspx?associd=123&guid=1234-4567…  link in here.

4. Google will read the appointments and layer them on top of your calendar. You can change the name and whether the calendar is shared by editing the settings. The resulting calendar looks like this:

These appointments will now also appear on your Android phone calendar if you have enabled calendar sync on your device

### Desktop Gadget

But what if you don't want to turn on your phone to check your SuperOffice calendar? What if you just want to glance at the desktop and see where you are supposed to be?

The **Windows Live Calendar Gadget** is just what you need.

1. Download the latest gadget from `http://wlcalendargadget.codeplex.com/`

2. Install the gadget and then right-click the desktop and choose GADGETS.
