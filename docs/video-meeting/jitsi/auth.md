# Authenticate and authorize Jitsi Meet

This is step 5 in [connecting your provider][1]. It is provider-specific.

There is no authenticate or validation, or need to confirm to connect it to SuperOffice. This provider does not have any additional configuration settings.

If it says "Connected to Jitsi Meet. Logged in as xxx and connected to custxxxx", you may close this browser window - to go back to SuperOffice "Settings and maintenance" to confirm the setup.
