# Troubleshooting

## Something went wrong reserving your video meeting. Please try again later

**Problem:** If SuperOffice Online is not able to provide video meetings with a valid context-identifier (used for getting correct API-credentials) when a user logs in to CRM Online, the user will get an errorÂ in the client when creating the video meeting:

**Solution:** The user should try to log out of CRM Online and then log in to CRM Online again to get a valid context-identifier.

## 404 OOPS. Something went wrong!

**Problem:** The user is disconnected due to problems with authentication towards the video provider.

**Solution:** To resolve this, the [user has to remove the video-meetings configuration][1] in SuperOffice and [remove the video meeting app in Google][2] to re-authenticate.
