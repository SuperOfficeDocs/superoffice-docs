# Authenticate and authorize Webex Meetings

This is step 5 in [connecting your provider][1]. It is provider-specific.

> [!NOTE]
> We are currently in the process of approving this app, Before the app get final approval by Cisco, you will be able to authorize the app by adding the SuperOffice app from the Cisco app store

1. Add the SuperOffice app from the Cisco app store, by supplying our Integration ID when asked:

    ```

    The SuperOffice app for Cisco Webex integration ID will be added to your Cisco Webex admin page at [https://admin.webex.com][2]:

If it says "Connected to Webex. Logged in as xxx and connected to custxxxx", and password is filled under **Set Configurations**, you may close this browser window - to go back to SuperOffice Settings and maintenance to confirm the setup.
