# Create a video meeting

You can easily set up a video meeting when [creating a follow-up][1].

1. Go to the Follow-up dialog (example: go to the diary and create a new appointment).

2. Click ![inactive][img1] next to the meeting type (for instance Business meeting). The icon changes to ![active][img2] and a video meeting link is added.

    Note: The first time you select the video icon (![inactive][img1]), a new window will open. Here you need to sign in to authenticate your user in the video meeting service defined by your administrator.

3. Complete the information in the dialog as described in the [Dialog for follow-ups][2].

If you have turned on email invitations for the participants of the follow-up, an email with a link to join the video meeting will be sent when the appointment is saved. In the diary, follow-ups with video meetings are displayed with the icon ![in diary][img3].

> [!TIP]
> Click ![copy link][img4] to copy the video meeting link. You can then paste the link in the description of the appointment or send it to others via direct messaging.
