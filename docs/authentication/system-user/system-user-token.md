# System user tokens

A _system user token_ is a  contract between an application and a tenant

This component is coupled with the [application][1] in the Operation Centre, and is only included in the JWT or `id_token` when an administrator signs in to SuperID.

Technically, the system user token is a String formatted as `NAME_OF_APP-<some_random_characters>` that:

* is unique for each [tenant][2] application
* will exist for the lifetime of the application
* is included in the JWT claims when an administrator signs in to the application

A system user token remains the same and will not change for the lifetime of the application.

## How is the system user token used?

The system user token is primarily a means to perform [non-interactive operations][3] on the APIs. It is:

* used to [obtain a valid system user ticket][4] credential from SuperID
* used by the application for all future background processing

This token is **not** used for direct access to any customer tenant web services. For that, you need the [system user *ticket*][5].

In the future, system user functionality will be replaced with OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow, which will not have the sliding expiration behavior.

## Where does the system user token come from?

You will receive the system user token in the [JWT claim][6], or `id_token`.

* the token is only generated if system user token functionality is requested during application registration

* the token is only created and added as a claim when a customer administrator has successfully authenticated and [approved the application for the tenant][7]

It is up to the application to securely store the system user token.
