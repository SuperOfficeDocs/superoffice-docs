# Standard apps for SuperOffice Online

Standard applications are built to fit many and available in the SuperOffice App Store. In contrast, custom applications are one-off customizations for your company or a customer's company only.

Standard [applications][1] are owned by, operated by, and the responsibility of SuperOffice partners. You become a cloud partner when you sign our sub-DPA, which you need to publish your standard application to the App Store.

All applications begin in our [sandbox environment][2]. Standard applications must pass our [certification][3] and [security evaluation][4] by Watchcom. After that, you may list your application in our App Store.
