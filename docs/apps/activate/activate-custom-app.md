# First-time activation

Congratulations, your custom application is ready!

By activating a custom application, the owner of the tenant agrees to [subscribe to Development Tools][2] (formerly Expander Services).

## First-time activation

The first-time activation starts after your [application passes validation][1]. You don't need to trigger this step.

1. We will move your application from SOD to the production environment.
2. You contact the customer to initiate the [application setup][3].
3. The customer's administrator must sign in to SuperOffice and [give their consent][4] to allow your application to access their database tenant.

## Request application changes

You can [change the application configuration][5] in the Developer Portal.
