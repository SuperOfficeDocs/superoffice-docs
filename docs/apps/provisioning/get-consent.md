# Obtain consent to access a customer's tenant

Each customer is responsible for their data and must explicitly approve each and every application that shall have access to their database in the production environment.

> [!CAUTION]
> External consultants **MAY NOT** approve access to a customer's production database!

1. Send the administrator to the authorization endpoint and [authenticate the user][1].

2. The administrator clicks **I approve**. The dialog shows your application name, your company name, and other information relevant to the [consent][2].
