# Obtain consent to access a customer's tenant

Each customer is responsible for their data and must explicitly approve each and every application that shall have access to their database in the production environment.

> [!CAUTION]
> External consultants **MAY NOT** approve access to a customer's production database!

1. Send the administrator to the authorization endpoint and [authenticate the user][1].

2. The administrator clicks **I approve**. The dialog shows your application name, your company name, and other information relevant to the [consent][2].

3. Provision the application.

## Potential Errors

You are unable to complete providing consent (Approve) to the application.

This means that SuperOffice Operations Center does not recognize your user as an administrator.

### How to resolve 'account does not have access' error

You can resolve this issue by signing in to SuperOffice, navigate to settings and maintenance (admin), then make a change to the user like user level or role and then save. Next, change back and save again.

Your user is now able to successfully approve the application.
