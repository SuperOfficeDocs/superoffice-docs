# About our validation process for custom apps

We require all custom applications to pass a set of validation tests before they are activated.

Unlike [standard applications][1], [custom applications][2] don't have to go through certification and Watchcom security testing. Instead, we do light-weight testing called **validation**.

We run the validation tests in [SOD][3] before we deploy your application to a production environment. These tests are **free of charge**.

## Why do you test my one-off customization?

The purpose of our validation tests is to ensure that the [application can be safely activated][4] in SuperOffice CRM Online.

## What are you checking?

We install your application and want to see that it runs smoothly and adheres to our [requirements][5]. **Security** and **performance** are particularly important.

We are checking logs in Application Insight and our Operation Center.

## I'm ready - what do I do?

Follow our [step-by-step guide][6], started by sending a validation request form.
