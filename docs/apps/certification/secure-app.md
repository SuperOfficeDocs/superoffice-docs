# Pass Watchcom initial security evaluation

The Watchcom security evaluation is a mandatory part of our certification program.

## Pre-requisites

* You have [submitted your standard application for certification][1].
* Your designated certification contact must be available during the test period.
* We have screened your application and approved it for our staging environment (`qaonline.superoffice.com`).

We may send you multiple sets of keys at the same time. You will **not** be able to connect using the production keys until you pass the security evaluation and we explicitly activate them!

## Workflow

1. We send you the [application keys][2] for both [stage and production][3].

2. You set up the application in stage and **make sure that it still works**.

3. Your certification contact notifies us that you are ready to proceed.

4. We run a quick verification to confirm that you are ready for Watchcom.

5. We prepare a **Handover document** and send it to Watchcom. It explains:

    * What does the application add?
    * How does the application work with SuperOffice?

6. Our Watchcom contact will get in touch with your certification contact to schedule a date and time for testing. [Read more about the test scope][4].

7. After the test, you get the full report from Watchcom while we only receive a pass/fail notification. **It is your responsibility to fix any red flags!**

8. When approved, we activate the application's keys to the production environment.

9. You can now set up the application in production and connect to test that it works. **The application is still not published!**

**Next steps:** [get listed in the App Store][5] and [publish your application][6]
