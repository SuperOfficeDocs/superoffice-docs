# The App Store marketplace

[!include[ALT](../includes/def-app-store.md)]

Customers can browse the store to find a range of applications made available from both SuperOffice and our partners.

## Open to all SuperOffice CRM Online customers

The SuperOffice App Store is transparent and open to any applications that represent a clear business value to your customers and users, SuperOffice, and partners.

* Anonymous users may browse the marketplace (without login)
* Signed-in users can view their purchased and installed applications
* Signed-in users must have an active subscription to SuperOffice CRM Online to buy an application

### Marketplace, not a webshop

SuperOffice will not bill, [provision][1], or host partner applications. Instead, the App Store redirects to our partners' websites where customers buy directly from the partner.
