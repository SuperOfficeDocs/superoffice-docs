# Building apps for SuperOffice

When creating an application for SuperOffice CRM Online, there are several key elements that all partners must understand. Explore our documentation to learn about security, authentication, validation, development environment, provisioning, and application models.

Partners building applications for SuperOffice CRM Online must be comfortable with **federated authentication**. All applications must use **SuperID** for authenticating users.

To develop applications in our SOD environment is free. Required licenses apply only in production (live).

## Workflow from a developer's perspective

1. Register as a developer to get access to our [environment][1].

    * Signs you up for a developer user account.
    * Creates a test [tenant][3] in SOD (can be shared by multiple developers within a company).

2. Register your application idea to get your [client ID and client secret (token)][3].

    * It's essential that you provide us with your [redirect URLs][4] at this point.
    * You receive a unique set of keys to identify your application and certificates for authentication.

3. Develop your application.

4. Test your application.

    * **standard application**: [get certified][6] and pass the security evaluation
    * **custom application**: [get validated][7]

5. Deploy your application.

    Your new standard or custom application has been developed and tested and is now ready to be put to work.

    * **standard application:** [launch in the App Store][8]

    * **custom application**: [activate][9] for one specific customer's database

### Upgrade

We take precautions to ensure that no individual upgrade plan compromises data or the availability of services for any customers. This includes informing you about new versions, what's changing, and when it's deployed - with the opportunity to test and update your offerings in line with the SuperOffice CRM Online services.

## Preferred technology stack

All types of technology platforms, including Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, and many more can integrate with NetServer web services.

Any technology stack that supports web services can connect to and exchange data with SuperOffice NetServer via REST or SOAP protocols.

For SOAP SuperOffice supplies .NET proxy assemblies as NuGet packages. All other technology platforms must generate their own proxies, or use raw SOAP/XML, to access the web services.

## Set up your SuperOffice app development environment

Before you begin coding, the application must be [registered in the Developer Portal][2].

## Confused about where to start?

If you are new to developing for SuperOffice CRM Online, a good place to start is reading up on key concepts.
