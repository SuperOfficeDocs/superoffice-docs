# Add or update redirection endpoints

The redirection endpoints are specified and whitelisted when you register the application idea.

All changes to whitelisted URLs have to go through SuperOffice.

## Pre-requisite

* You have registered your application idea
* You are (or will be) handling web service requests at the new endpoints

## To update

[Submit a change request][1]Â (form).

* We ask for the [Client ID][2] (AppId)
* Which environment do you want the change for ([SOD, stage, or production][3])
* For each URL:
  * is it new or replacing an existing redirect? (specify old URL)
  * is whitelisting sufficient or is it a CORS redirect?

> [!CAUTION]
> If you add database mirroring or webhooks, the tenant administrator must [renew the consent][4] to your application. **Users will be locked out from when the change happens until the consent has been given.**
