# Custom apps for SuperOffice CRM Online

Custom applications are one-off customizations for your company or a customer's company only. These are not available in the SuperOffice App Store.

A custom application can be the solution when your needs as a SuperOffice CRM Online customer are not met using either:

* the standard configurations available in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, or
* a standard application available in the App Store

As long as the application is specific to you, unique to your business, we call it a custom application. In contrast to [standard applications][2], each custom application is mapped to a specific [database tenant][3].

All applications begin in our [sandbox environment][4]. Custom applications must [pass our validation process][5]. We test that things work the way they should and don't affect other customers in any way. After that, you may [activate][6] your application on your production environment tenant.

## Your options with custom applications

Custom applications require a subscription to [Expander Services][7] to get access to the necessary tools and APIs. With this toolbox, you can:

* Add extra tables to customize Service
* Create custom screens to fit your specific processes
* Create tailored workflows and automation with CRMScript
* Create custom integrations thatÂ link your SuperOffice CRM Online solution with another system
  * either a totally new integration to a solution you currently use and that is specific to you
  * or a customized version of a standard application available in the App Store

Also, you can make extra tables and custom screens available to users of the Sales and Marketing [user plans][8] through web panels.

When it is time to develop your application idea, you have 3 options:

* Build the application yourself
* Ask a SuperOffice partner for help to create a customization
* Ask a vendor to create a tailored version of a standard application for you
