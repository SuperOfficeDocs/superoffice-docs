# Endpoints

An endpoint is the address, port, and protocol a web service is exposed at. In short, the web service **URL**.

## WebAPI

[!include[Intro to the WebAPI](../../includes/webapi-intro.md)]

### Getting started

* [Get the version number][14] and build date from the **API endpoint**: `/api`
* Get a list of supported URLs using the version URL: `/api/v1`

> [!NOTE]
> If your installation is protected from the internet by a reverse proxy, the **URLs generated by the WebAPI** will be wrong. For more info, see [the IIS config section][13].

### Authorization (WebAPI)

* [Authorization options and how to configure them][3]
* [How to reuse sessions with XSRF-TOKEN][4]

### HTTP request headers

* [Accept-Language][5]
* [Content-Type][6]
* [If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since][7]

## SOAP

* Learn about the SOAP API [endpoints][9] such as Services88.
* Use a [built-in or custom proxy][10].
* Check out the [latest reference][12].

### Authorization (SOAP)

* [Proxy authentication using SoSession][8]
* [Direct authentication using a Ticket][11]
