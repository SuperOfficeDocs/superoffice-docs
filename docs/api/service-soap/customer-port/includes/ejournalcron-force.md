To force an update run the following command from the command line:

* Windows: `C:\Service\bin\ejournalCron -force [mydomain.com]`
* Linux: `/usr/local/ejournal/bin/ejournalCron -force [mydomain.com]`

Replace \[mydomain.com\] with the domain SuperOffice is registered on. On some systems, the **ejournalCron** command is located in other folders.
