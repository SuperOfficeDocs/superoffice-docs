# Online Quote Connectors

Quote connectors allow third parties to build a web service endpoint that supplies SuperOffice with product price-list and product details.

* [Online SOAP Quote Connector API][soap]
* [Online REST Quote Connector API][rest]

Use the [SuperOffice.Crm.Online.IntegrationServices][1] package to build a quote connector for SuperOffice Online. This has two package dependencies:

* [SuperOffice.Crm.Online.Core][2]
* [SuperOffice.NetServer.Services][3]

`SuperOffice.Crm.Online.Core` contains the authentication interface to successfully authenticate and connect to your quote connector web service endpoint.

`SuperOffice.NetServer.Services` is necessary because connectors often need to call the tenant's web services for additional information. The packet has additional dependencies.

In total you will have the following NuGet package dependencies:

* [SuperOffice.Crm.Online.Core][1]
* [SuperOffice.Crm.Online.IntegrationServices][2]
* [SuperOffice.NetServer.Core][9]
* [SuperOffice.NetServer.Services][3]
* [SuperOffice.ContinuousDatabase][4]
* [System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt][5]

There is an example quote connector example included in our [SuperOffice.DevNet.Online][6] GitHub repository, located in the [IntegrationServer][7] folder. Take a look at the *README.md*  markdown file for more information.
