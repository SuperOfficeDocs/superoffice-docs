## Product and price list information

This part of the connector interface searches the ERP systemâ€™s product and price list information.

If an ERP system does not provide products, the product searches can be delegated to the built-in SuperOffice product registry by using the `QuoteConnectorExtender` class as a base.

Currencies are specified in ISO 3-letter codes: USD, NOK, SEK, EUR, GBP, etc. See [www.currency-iso.org][1] for details. All `isoCurrencyCode` parameters below are case-insensitive ISO currency like USD or NOK.

The price lists are accessed from the SuperOffice CRM client.

The client uses `FindProduct` to do simple searches. You can set filters on the available price lists.

## int GetNumberOfActivePriceLists(string isoCurrencyCode )

Is used to warn the user if there are no active price lists in a given currency. Will return no of all active price lists if `isoCurrencyCode` is empty.

## PriceListInfo[] GetActivePriceLists( string isoCurrencyCode )

Used by SuperOffice to provide filters. Gets the available active `PriceLists` in a specific currency.

Will return all price lists if `isoCurrencyCode` is empty. Returns an empty array if there is no `PriceList` with the stated currency available.

## PriceListInfo[] GetAllPriceLists( string isoCurrencyCode )

Gets all `PriceLists` in the given currency, including those inactive. Will return all price lists if `isoCurrencyCode` is empty. Will return an empty array if there is no `PriceList` available.

Currently not used.
