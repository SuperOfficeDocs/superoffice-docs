# "location" MDO List

Implements the mdo provider for the list of avaiable locations. This list aggregates elements
from different sources like contact, person, associate, participants and resources to build
a list that represents all the relevant, available locations that can be used when creating
a new appointment.

The provider uses a set of name/value pairs in the additionalinfo parameter used in the construct()
function. The available names are:

ownercontactid (mandatory):     id of the contact for the owner of the appointment
currentassociate (mandatory):   currently logged in associate
appointmentcontactid:           id of the contact in the appointment
appointmentpersonid:            id of the person in the appointment
appointmentid:                  id of existing appointment
startdate:                      startdate used for conflict resolution
enddate:                        enddate used for conflict resolution
participantpersonidlist:        comma separated list of existing participant person ids
participantassociateidlist:     comma separated list of existing participant associate ids(resources)

Implemented by the <see cref="T:SuperOffice.CRM.Lists.LocationListProvider">LocationListProvider</see> class.
The name of the MDO list is 'location'.
