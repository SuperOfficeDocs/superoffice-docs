# Improvements in 7.5

* The [ERP Connector APIs][1] added to support integration with ERP systems.

* `IContactInfo` and `IProjectInfo` and so on can find udef field values by progid, not just absolute field name.

* `IDocumentPlugin2` has changed. Parameters now include more complete information - not just id and extref. A complete `DocumentInfo` object is passed, so doc plugins should not need to link directly with `SoDatabase`.
