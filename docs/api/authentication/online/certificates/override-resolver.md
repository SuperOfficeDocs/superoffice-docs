# How to override the certificate resolver

> [!NOTE]
> This information applies only if validating the security token using the **SuperOffice.Online.Core NuGet package**. See the [Validate security tokens][1] page to see all options.

To override the default behavior of JWT security token validation is required when you deploy your application in a restricted environment where you have no access to the certificate store. This is the case **when you deploy to a cloud application server**.

When you override the [security token validation routine][1], you need only 1 certificate, *SuperOfficeFederatedLogin.crt*. If you use the default PeerTrust validation, you need [all 3 certificates][2].

This override short-circuits the PeerTrust validation, or certificate dependencies, by setting the **CertificateValidator** property to `None`.

`tokenHandler.CertificateValidator = X509CertificateValidator.None;`

This allows the certificate routines to bypass certificate validation, and directly validate the JWT security token with the provided certificate.

**Pre-requisites:**

* Your application has an *App_Data* folder containing the *SuperOfficeFederatedLogin.crt* certificate.
* `CertificateValidator` property is set to **None**.
* The certificate type must be **X509Certificate2**.

For JWT security tokens, the application must override the `JwtIssuerSigningCertificate` property.

The  X509Certificate2 constructor accepts a file name argument and is the file name of the certificate that will be used to validate the security token.

The full path to the  *App_Data* folder containing *SuperOfficeFederatedLogin.crt* is passed to the constructor.

[!code-csharp[ValidateToken()](includes/validate-token.cs)]

The `ValidateToken` method will return a [SuperIdToken][1] populated with all the claims returned by SuperOffice CRM Online.

This operation will fail if the token is not JWT or if the certificate is missing.

## How to override the certificate resolver for legacy SAML tokens

This code allows the certificate routines to bypass certificate validation, and directly validate the **SAML** security token with the provided certificate. This is no longer the preferred method.

We recommend that you use [JWT security tokens][1].

This override short-circuits the PeerTrust validation, or certificate dependencies, by setting the `CertificateValidator` property to **None**.

```csharp
tokenHandler.CertificateValidator = X509CertificateValidator.None;
```

**Pre-requisites:**

* Your application has an *App_Data* folder containing the *SuperOfficeFederatedLogin.crt* certificate.
* `CertificateValidator` property is set to *None*.

For SAML tokens, the application must override the `IssueTokenResolver` property with a class that knows how to resolve certificates.

SuperOffice provides the `CertificateFileCertificateStoreTokenResolver` class. Its constructor accepts a path where it will search for certificates with a .crt, .cer, or .pfx file extension.

```csharp
public SuperIdToken ValidateToken(string token)
{
  var tokenHandler = new SuperIdTokenHandler();
```

The `ValidateToken` method will return a [SuperIdToken][1] populated with all the claims returned by SuperOffice CRM Online.

This operation will fail if the token is not SAML or if the certificate is missing.
