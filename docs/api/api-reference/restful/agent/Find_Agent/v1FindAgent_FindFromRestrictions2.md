# POST Agents/Find/FindFromRestrictions2

```http
POST /api/v1/Agents/Find/FindFromRestrictions2
```

Execute a Find operation and return a page of results.

The criteria for the Find are passed in directly, not fetched by a restriction storage provider. The columns of the result are calculated based on the restriction. 

Archive Restriction strings are OData or SQL-ish.
They are parsed and converted into ArchiveRestrictions.


For example:

```

"name begins 'Super'"
"category = 3"
"category in (2,3,4)"
"xstop set"
"registered after '2014.3.4'"
"registered dateBetween ('2014.11.29', '2014.12.25')"

```

Unary operators:

```
"updatedDate lastWeek", "assocId currentAssociate"
```


## Brackets and or
AND and OR can be used to combine terms. AND has a higher priority than OR

```
"business = 2  AND name contains 'super'"
```

Brackets can be used for grouping.

```
"(business = 2 or category = 3) and name contains 'super'"
```


## Aggregation operators

The column names can encode grouping and summarizing.
You add functions and modifiers to the column name to trigger aggregation.


Example: group last names together, and inject a header row for each group.

```

GroupBy(lastName):Header

```

Example: count instances of middle names, and hide the individual rows, 
report just the totals for each group using a footer. Note how the modifiers stack.

```

Count(middleName):HideDetail:Footer

```

Example: the aggregator functions can nest, so you can say

```

GroupBy(DatePart(personUpdatedDate):YearMonth):Header

```
## Strings

Use the begins or contains operators to do string searches.
You can also use the normal = operator to do string exact match checks.



Use backslash to escape single quotes in strings
(note that backslash needs to be doubled because c# also uses backslash escapes):


```
"department contains 'Bob\\'s'"
```
