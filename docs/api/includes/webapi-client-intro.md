The WebApi Client offers an alternative to the existing SuperOffice NetServer WCF proxies. **[SuperOffice.WebApi][2]** has the exact same Agent-style services as [SuperOffice.NetServer.Services][1] while adopting modern practices, such as asynchronous methods.

This library is a **.NET Standard 2.0 library** that works with both .NET Framework (4.6.1 and higher) and .NET Core (2.0 and higher) applications.
