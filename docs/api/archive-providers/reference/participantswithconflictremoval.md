# "ParticipantsWithConflictRemoval"

This provider name is implemented by the class <see cref="T:SuperOffice.CRM.ArchiveLists.ParticipantsWithConflictRemovalProvider">SuperOffice.CRM.ArchiveLists.ParticipantsWithConflictRemovalProvider</see> inside NetServer's SODatabase assembly.

Archive provider that wraps the <see cref="T:SuperOffice.CRM.ArchiveLists.ParticipantsProvider" />, and adds a pseudo entity used to hide associates with conflicts.

This provider is used by the Assign To dialog, where an associate list with conflict markers is shown. This list has a checkbox
with the text 'hide conflicts', and its effect is to remove from the list those that do have a conflict.

This class implements the functionality by wrapping the existing participants provider, adds an optional entity to get
the checkbox, and performs filtering if the entity is chosen. It also ensures that the relevant column is ordered from the
inner participants provider, so that the conflict checking is performed.
