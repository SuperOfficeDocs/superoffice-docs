# POST Agents/Diagnostics/PerformTasksAfterUpgrade

```http
POST /api/v1/Agents/Diagnostics/PerformTasksAfterUpgrade
```

After upgrading to a new fileset, there may be tasks that need to be done.

Examples - import new TypicalSearches, if present. Tasks performed here need to be idempotent and independent of the actual upgrade jump (what was the previous version). They should complete in a reasonable time, not more than a few minutes maximum.
