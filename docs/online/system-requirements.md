# System requirements for SuperOffice CRM Online

CRM Online is the same as our Web client, but since our strategy is to deliver news on our Online platform first, the System requirements may change for this platform first.

## Operating systems

* Windows 11
* Windows 10
* Windows 8.1
* Mac OS 11.0 (Big Sur)

* Support for Google and Microsoft 365 authentication and document storage

### Documents in CRM online

* File size: Max 94,4 MB
* Timeout on file upload: 5 min

This means that you need about 2,5 - 3 Mbit/sec upload speed to be able to add/edit a 94 MB file to CRM online.

### Attachments inÂ Mailings and Request

* Max size per mailing or request: 25 MB

This is both incoming and outgoing. For example, one request (ticket) cannot have 3 attachments where each attachment is 10 MB.
