# Enforce a password policy

Password policy is currently handled by SuperID or your identity provider.

## Online

The password policy for SuperOffice CRM **Online** is enforced either by [SuperID][1] or - if you use federated identities - by your [identity provider][2].

**It is not possible to set customer-specific policies in the Admin client**, because CRM Online, unfortunately,Â has no way of telling the user what the current policy is, and we would like to avoid that users have to guess.

## Onsite

You can read more about [policies for **onsite** installations][3] in our forums.
