# Update SuperOffice username to match IdP username

Before using a federated sign-in service, you must update each SuperOffice username to match the IdP username.

> [!TIP]
> The username, also known as the **User-Principal-Name** (UPN), set in your IdP must match the username set in SuperOffice Admin.

## Pre-requisites

* SuperOffice administrator account

* Access to view user accounts of your identity provider

The username you are going to map to is commonly (but not always) the **primary email** registered to the user account at the identity provider: `user@domain`.

## Look up the IdP username

You can find the username in the **admin>users** section.

**For Microsoft:**

Go to [https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/users][1]

**For Google:**

## Change username in SuperOffice Admin client

> [!NOTE]
> You **need to map each username** in SuperOffice Admin to the federated ID.

1. Select **Users** from the navigator in the Admin client.

2. For each user:

    1. Select the SuperOffice user to change.
    2. Enter the new username and click **Save**.
