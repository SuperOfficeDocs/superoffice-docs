# Identity providers and document handling

Let's look at how SuperID changes how you use and set up identity providers (IdP) and document handling.

## Before SuperID

* Microsoft and Google identity providers require Cloud Office.

* Other identity providers are not available.

* SharePoint and Google Workspace integration must be set up manually by R&D services.

## With SuperID

* Microsoft or Google IdP is supported. We offer self-service + advanced additional configuration that can be set up by R&D services. For example, sub-domains and custom domains.

* Other identity providers are available on request if they support OpenID Connect.

* [Google Workspace integration][1] is self-service.

* [Microsoft 365 integration][2] must be set up manually for the time being, but self-service is planned for upcoming releases.
