# Manual steps to install Service

From SuperOffice 8.1 both SuperOffice Web and Service must run on the same root domain. It will be easier to create Application Routing Routing rules (ARR) if you do the manual installation and place Service in a sub-application.

Installing SuperOffice Web client and Service on the same domain under different applications requires some manual steps for Service.

## Install Service

If the IIS website is not created, first run the installer for Service (SuperOffice.CustomerService.exe) which is the only installer from SuperOffice that will also create the IIS websites.

If the website is created, then you may create the application first, and just point the path to the default location for Customer Service: *c:SuperOffice*

Run **SuperOffice.CustomerService.exe** to install the software on the server, the default location is *c:\SuperOffice*.

If you upgrade an existing site, do not tick the Create IIS website since it will cause the installer to fail. We will create/update the application manually.

Either set up a new application under `socrm.myorganization.com` for Service or edit the one you created earlier. Point the physical path to the *Customer service\www\doc* folder, in this example, it would be *c:\SuperOffice\Customer Service\www\doc* folder

Below service, you also need to add 2 applications, one for scripts, which points to the *Customer Service\www\scripts* folder. Make sure it uses the same application pool as the Service application.

And one application for csplugins pointing to *\customer service\www\csplugins*

## Make sure NetServer is available first

You need remote web services / NetServer installed on the same domain, in this example, we have used `socrm.myorganization.com/netserver`. This is installed by using the [web installer][1] to the Sales web client, and in the product configurator, tick the **Expose NetServer web services** on the Security chapter.

Browse to `http://socrm.myorganization.com/Sales/Remote/Services84/Contact.svc` to verify before the ejTermSetup.exe is run to prime the database for Service.

## Continue with priming the database for Service

ejTermSetup.exe is only run for NEW installations

Now run ejTermSetup found in the Bin folder, when asked for Hostname give the path including the application, `socrm.myorganization.com/service` which will correctly set the value for database table registry where `reg_id = 109` to /service/

![x -screenshot][img9]

When ejtermsetup later asks for **The full HTTP Path to your server (for URLs)**, then just use the hostname without sub-application, like `http://socrm.myorganization.com`. It will in most cases default to the correct URL.

When asked for the **NetServer URL** you give the URL for NetServer created on the same domain. Note: Service does not support HTTPS connection to NetServer, so only HTTP is allowed.

From SuperOffice 8.1, all authentication for all clients will be done by the web client, and after successfully authenticating a session key is stored in a browser cookie. This is why Sales and Service must be installed on the same domain.

After completing the ejTermSetup you may start `https://socrm.myorganization.com/service/scripts/rms.fcgi` (or.exe) - note that if your screen is completely missing pictures, then it's the `reg_id=109` that has a wrong value.

## Verify the database registry and config table values

If Service is installed in a sub-folder of the domain named *service*, then

`select * from crm7.registry where reg_id = 109`

should have value */service/*

`select cgi_bin, cgi_url, cgi_url_internal from crm7.config`
