# Update prototype

An **update prototype** is a copy of the central database and contains the same information that the central database contained when the update prototype was generated.

## Why use an update prototype?

It is much quicker and more efficient to copy a single file than to copy data from a complex database (by a factor of 50 or more). With the prototype as an intermediary, the local update is performed more rapidly.

## Usage

At any stage after an update prototype has been generated, each individual user will be able to perform a local update to transfer information from the central database to his or her own local database.

> [!NOTE]
> You may use different kinds of travel databases on the different areas, but you need to use a supported travel database type.
