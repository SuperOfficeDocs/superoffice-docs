# Sybase as Travel database

## Prerequisites

* Client computers must install Sybase

## Automatic setup

As long as the central database has set up Sybase as the Local datatype, everything is automatically set up for the user who has been [assigned travel rights in SOAdmin][1]. The central *SuperOffice.ini* file has the information, so SOLoader.exe sets up the local datasource.

[!include[ALT](../includes/local-update.md)]

## Manual setup

Default paths set up automatically are:

```text
local_archivepath=c:\Documents and Settings\USER\Local Settings\Application Data\SuperOffice\SO_LOCAL
Local_Datapath=ODBC:SuperOfficeLocal
```

The ODBC datasource will by default put the local database file in:

`C:\Documents and Settings\USER\Local Settings\Application Data\SuperOffice\SO_LOCAL\DATA\SoTravel.db`

If you want to change the location of the local document archive or the travel database, you need to edit the users' *SuperOffice.ini* file and the users ODBC datasource SuperOfficeLocal. You may change the name of the datasource as long as you also change the `Local_Datapath=ODBC:XXX` where XXX needs to be the new name of the local datasource.

### Change the local datasource

Make sure the local *SuperOffice.ini* now says `Local_Datapath=ODBC:MYTravelDB`
