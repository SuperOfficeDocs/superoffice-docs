# Troubleshooting problems with satellite management

## Problems with satellite generation

The most common problem with a Satellite generation is not enough disk space on the hard disk. Free up disk space and try again.

## Problem viewing all company employees in the Our contact field

If you have not included the user's name in the Satellite area definition who is the Our Contact for the Home Company in the central database, the total number of employees in the company will not display in the Our Contact pop-up field in the Satellite database. Only the Satellite's own employees are listed.

## Problem not having access to SOAdmin

Make sure at least one of the contacts in the Satellite company has **General administrator functional right**, otherwise you can't access the admin client.

## The button to create new users is not available on the satellite

This is by design, all users must be added centrally and then replicated down after they are given the correct rights. Make sure the central admin remembers to add the user to the area and also their data.
