# Send passwords to contacts

1. Open the Contact screen.

2. Click ![icon][img1] **Task** and select **Send password**.

3. In the **Send password to contact** screen, verify that the contents of the **To** (recipient address), **From** (sender address) and **Subject** fields are correct. Optionally, adjust the data that was inserted automatically.

4. Click **Preview HTML** or **Preview plain text** to view the message that will be sent out.

5. Click **OK**. The email is sent.

> [!TIP]
