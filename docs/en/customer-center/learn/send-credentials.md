1. Click ![icon][img1] **Task** and select **Manage customer centre user**.

1. Click **Send password**.

1. In the dialog, verify that the contents of the **To** (recipient address), **From** (sender address) and **Subject** fields are correct. Optionally, adjust the data that was inserted automatically.

1. Click **Preview HTML** or **Preview plain text** to view the message that will be sent out.

1. Click **OK**. The email is sent.

> [!TIP]
