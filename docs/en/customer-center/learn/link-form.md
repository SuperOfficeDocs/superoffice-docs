# Use web forms in your Customer centre

You can use integrated web forms to capture information from the customers who visit your Customer centre and automatically save this information in SuperOffice.

By adding the chat widget to the Customer centre, you can facilitate your customers to ask for help and get the answer they are looking for instantly.

## Before you begin

You need to [create a web form][3] before you add it to your Customer centre. Remember that when you create a new web form, you need to add one of the three request elements â€“ title, category, and message. Otherwise, you will not be able to add the form to your Customer centre.

1. Go to Settings and maintenance.

1. After you are in the Customer centre page, open the **Options** tab.

1. Scroll down the list of options and check the Use custom "Contact us" form box.

When a customer completes this form, the information and details will automatically be saved in SuperOffice as a request under the category and the priority you have defined for this form.
