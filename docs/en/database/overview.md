# Expander SDK: database documentation

This documentation describes the internal SuperOffice database. It also explains the naming conventions and how the individual database tables are related to each other.

After reading this section, you should have a good understanding of the product's database structure and be able to access, edit, and insert new records into the SuperOffice database.

The examples show how to insert, update, and manipulate data in a SuperOffice database.

## Target audience

This is technical content targeted at developers. It is not for the typical SuperOffice user.

We assume that you have a basic, working knowledge of databases. In particular, you should be familiar with terms such as table (or file), column (or field), row (or record), relation, checksum, and database dictionary.

It is also important to know basic SQL.

## Reading advice
