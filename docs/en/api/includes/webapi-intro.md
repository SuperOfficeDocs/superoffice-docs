The HTTP WebAPI comes in two parts:

* **REST WebAPI** - URLs describe entities like person or sale: [Learn][1] | [Download Swagger File][5] | [Reference][3]
* **Agents WebAPI** - the services API accessible via HTTP: [Learn][2] | [Download Swagger File][6] | [Reference][4]

Swagger files for individuals endpoints are also available for both APIs: [REST Individuals Swagger][7] | [Agents Individuals Swagger][8].

While the Agents WebAPI is the most complete of the two, the REST WebAPI covers the most common use cases and is easier to use and navigate.
