# NetServer configuration

Each application that uses NetServer must contain a well-defined configuration file. This is imperative for both Windows and web applications.

This section contains all available settings to configure SuperOffice NetServer and provides explanations and examples for each section.

* Windows Application: *MyApp.exe.config*
* Web Application: *web.config*

The configuration file must contain a section group named `SuperOffice`. Under it, additional sections and section groups are required that define NetServer configuration elements needed to operate.

Below is a configuration file with only the bare essential SuperOffice sections defined:

[!code-xml[XML](includes/web.config)]

## SuperOffice section group

[!code-xml[the SuperOffice section group](includes/section-group-SuperOffice.xml)]

In between the ending `configSections` and `configuration` element, there must be a `<SuperOffice></SuperOffice>` element that defines the values that set the NetServer runtime behavior.

View one of the available sections to learn more about the property settings available in each one.

> [!TIP]
> Consider using the [ConfigFile utility class][1] to access the SuperOffice section in the config file.
