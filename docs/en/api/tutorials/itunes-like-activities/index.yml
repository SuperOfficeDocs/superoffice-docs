    This Windows application retrieves a list of activities for the past 6 months of the logged-in user. It also supports filtering the activities based on user input.

    Steps 2 and 3 explain how to retrieve activity information using the Activity Archive Provider and convert the retrieved information into a format that can be displayed in a data grid.
    The code segments use the **SuperOffice.CRM.ArchiveLists.ActivityArchiveProvider** to retrieve the activities.
