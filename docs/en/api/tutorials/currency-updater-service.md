# Currency updater service

**Purpose:** To automatically update the currency exchange rates in the `currency` table in SuperOffice.

## Implementation details

A Windows Service can call a web service to automatically update the currency rates once a day.

For that, a free web service from [http://www.webservicex.net/CurrencyConvertor.asmx][1] to get the currency rates. This service has a base method called `ConversionRate` with 2 parameters.

For example, we can use 2 currencies as parameters first one is the From currency(Base currency) next one is the To Currency

`ConversionRate("USD", "NOK")` gives value as 5.5352. This means it takes 5.5352 Norwegian Kroner to make one US Dollar.

Once the service starts to run, the `OnStart` method is invoked and starts the timer for a 24-hour time-interval. After 24 hours, the timer `ElapsedEventHandler` is fired and then it runs the `OnElapsedTime` method. This method includes all the basic concepts to update the currency rates.

The service continues to run until the `OnStop` event is triggered by the service manager.

### Code

Basic Code used in the application is given below.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/currency-converter.cs)]

Code segment from the App config file

### appSettings

```XML
<appSettings>
  <add key="UserName" value="SAL0" />
  <add key="Password" value="" />
</appSettings>
```

### Walk-through

In the app config file of the service, you must give the username and password in the `appSettings` element as shown above.

Within the `OnElapsedTime` method, it gets the `Username` and `Password` from the app config file to authenticate the user.

Using the `CurrencyConversionHelper` class, you can obtain the `BaseCurrencyId` and retrieve the `BaseCurrencyName`.

Currency Table data are filled into the `CurrencyRows` while reading the **SoDataReader**. For each Currency type in the CurrencyRows, update the Currency rate from the web service.

## Windows service installation process

To install the build Windows service:

1. Open a command line window by going to Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Microsoft Visual Studio.Net -&gt; Visual Studio.Net Tools -&gt; Visual Studio.Net Command Prompt
2. Change to the directory where the executable is located.
3. Enter the following command: `Installutil CurrencyUpdataterService.exe`

Now the service is installed. To start and stop the service, go to Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Services.  Right click the service and select Start.

To uninstall the Windows service:

`Installutil /u CurrencyUpdataterService.exe`
