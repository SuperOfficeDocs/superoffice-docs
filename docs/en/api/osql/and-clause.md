# AND clause

When writing queries you might have several conditions joined by simple and-clause. The example below demonstrates how to write the following SQL query in SuperOffice Objectified SQL.

```SQL
SELECT a.Name FROM Associate a WHERE a.AssociateId > 10 AND a.AssociateId < 100
```

Letâ€™s see how this SQL statement is written in SuperOffice Objectified SQL:

```csharp
using SuperOffice.Data;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Data;
using SuperOffice.Data.SQL;
using SuperOffice;
using(SoSession newSession = SoSession.Authenticate ("SAL0", ""))
{
  //Create a new connection
  SoConnection _con = null;
  SoCommand _cmd = null;
  _con = ConnectionFactory.GetConnection ();
  _cmd = _con.CreateCommand ();
  _con.Open ();
 
 AssociateTableInfo associateInfo = TablesInfo.GetAssociateTableInfo ();

  //Create a Select
  Select select = S.NewSelect ();

  //Setting the fields need to be returned
  select.ReturnFields.Add (associateInfo.Name);

  //setting the restrictions.
  select.Restriction = associateInfo.AssociateId.GreaterThan
         (S.Parameter (10)).And (associateInfo.AssociateId.LessThan
         (S.Parameter (100)));
  _cmd.SqlCommand = select;

  //Create a Reader
  SoDataReader reader = _cmd.ExecuteReader ();

  //Read Data
  while(reader.Read ())
  {
    listBox1.Items.Add (reader [0].ToString ());
  }
}
```

In this example, we have first [created a connection][1]. Once the connection is opened, you can make the query:

* You have to create an instance of the `Select` class, which holds the query.
* By adding the `Return` fields, it is possible to set the fields that need to be returned.
* The restrictions can be set by using the `Restriction` property of `Select`.

Once the query is built, you can assign it to the `SqlCommand` property of the `SoCommand` instance. Once the `SoCommand` is executed using the `ExeucteReader` method, it returns an instance of type `SoDataReader`, which can be used to read the retrieved data.

> [!NOTE]
> It is compulsory to add `ReturnFields` to the query. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown.
