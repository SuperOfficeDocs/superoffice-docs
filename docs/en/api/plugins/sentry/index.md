# Sentry plugins

Plugins are created using a `Factory` class based on the `IPlugin` interface and a plugin attribute. When creating a Sentry plugin, use the `ISentryPlugin` interface located in the `SuperOffice.CRM.Security` namespace.

A sentry plugin works out what information a particular user is allowed to see, and what the user can do with the information. A sentry plugin may rewrite the [OSQL queries][1] to get more information so it can make its decision.

A sentry plugin must look at the information available through the sentryâ€™s lookup objects, and use these values to figure out whether the current user can see, edit or delete the data. In this way, a Sentry plugin should be stateless. The plugin may be called many times with different rows of information.

## When is the Sentry plugin called?

![Sentry plugin sequence diagram][img1]

The diagram shows what happens when your client code causes a database access.

* The database access causes a Sentry and its plugins to be created, and the Sentry plugin gets a chance to modify the SELECT.

* After the data reader is returned, each row that is read is passed through the Sentry and each of its plugins to calculate the access rights.
