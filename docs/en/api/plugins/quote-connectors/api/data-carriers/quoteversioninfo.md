# QuoteVersionInfo

Represent a version of a quote

A quote is divided into one or more versions (or revisions, if you like), so a quote has 1..n `QuoteVersions`. A `QuoteVersion` always has a quote.

Even if versioning is disabled, a single version will exist.  When versioning is disabled, new versions are not created, but the only one is reused.
