# Saving the quote

![18][img1]

The sale is updated with the preferred alternative’s total amount when the **Quote** dialog is closed.

After the sale and quote have been written to the database, the `OnAfterSaveQuote` is called for each alternative in turn. The method cannot edit the quote – it is intended for the connector to update the ERP with any interesting changes (for keeping the ERP system up to date regarding the SuperOffice quote).
