# ErpActor

The `ErpActor` class describes the primary carrier that is passed to and from a Sync Connection. It is a representation of an ERP actor containing a key set of properties for identification and mandatory fields, along with a key-value list of fields and their values.

## ErpActor members

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| ActorType | string | The actor’s type (subset of a known list).<br>Although passed as a string, it is a textual representation of the internal enumerator `ErpActorType`. |
| ErpKey | string | The local identifier (primary key) for the actor in the given connection. This is proprietary and will only need to be readable by the connector itself. Erp Sync will store the value locally for mapping purposes, but will not need to parse it or understand it. |
| LastModified | string | Describes when the actor was last changed/modified. 100% mandatory. Used for timestamp comparison and sync loop retrieval. (see below) |
| ParentActorType | string | If the actor has a parent, the parent’s actor type is specified here<br>For example, if the actor is a contact person it will probably have a parent actor that might be a customer or vendor |
| ParentErpKey | string | The local identifier (primary key) for the parent  actor in the given connection |
|  FieldValues | Dictionary \<string,string> | Key-value pairs of field keys and [field values][1]. Field keys are supplied as specified by the given connection in the method `GetAvailableActorFields`. |

`LastModified` can be "any" timestamp, but there are 2 basic requirements:

* It needs to be incremental: when comparing two LastModified values on the same actor from the same connection, it must be possible to determine which one is older without knowing the specific format and build-up of the value itself.
* It needs to be "global", which means that if Erp Sync compares the timestamps of two different actors, it must be able to determine which one is newer. For this reason, a "version number" specific to each actor will not be sufficient.

Good type options are numeric or Datetime values.

## ErpActorType

For the connection, the `ErpActorType` value in combination with the ErpKey value will be the identifier that uniquely identifies each actor object.

For example, an `ErpActorType` value of *Customer* and `ErpKey` value of *12345* might probably mean that the connection should look in its customer table for the actor with customer ID 12345.

`ErpActorType` is an enumerator in *SuperOffice.Plugins*, but for communication purposes to and from the connector it is sent as a string ("Customer", "Supplier", and so on) to minimize future compatibility problems if the enumerator changes over time.

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Unknown  | Initial value for an undefined actor. Should not be used on actors passed back and forth between SO and a Sync Connection, because the receiving side will not have enough information to process the actor. |
| Customer | ERP customer (receivable account) |
|Supplier | ERP supplier/vendor (payable account) |
| Partner | An actor that is both a customer and supplier. Not typically supported in all ERP systems. |
| Person | Contact person. Will generally need to also have information about its parent actor supplied (ParentErpKey and ParentActorType). |
| Project | ERP project |
| Employee | ERP employee |
| Sale | ERP offer or order, or other representation of a sale. |

> [!NOTE]
> Employee and Sale are not currently supported in Erp Sync, but the connector may choose to offer these types for future compatibility.
