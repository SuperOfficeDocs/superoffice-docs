# Sale stakeholders

[!include[License requirement](../../../../../../common/includes/req-sales-prem.md)]

Use your favorite query tool and try this query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM saletype where hasStakeholders = 1
```

If there are sales defined with stakeholders, you may search the database for these sales:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM sale where saletype_id in (select saletype_id from saletype where hasStakeholders = 1)
```

For these sales we may look up the stakeholders, this will present the stakeholders for sale_id = 4

```SQL
SELECT * FROM salestakeholder where sale_id = 4
```

| salestakeholder_id | sale_id | contact_id | person_id | rank | stakeholderrole_id | registered | ... |
