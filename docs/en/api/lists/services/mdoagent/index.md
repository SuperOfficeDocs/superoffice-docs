# Multi-Departmental Organizational (MDO) API

## Available MDO API Endpoints

As the name implies, the `MDO` endpoint provides access to **all MDO lists**. The MDO API is used to retrieve lists and list items, both normal and selectable lists. Selectable lists are lists of selectable items such as interests, headings and user groups.

### RESTful REST endpoint

The endpoint is located at the `/api/v1/list/MDO` URL. See [API reference][2] for more details.

### HTTP RPC Agent

The endpoint is located at the `/api/v1/agents/MDO` URL. See [API reference][3] for more details.

### SOAP list endpoint

The endpoint is located at the `/Remote/Services88/MDO.svc` URL. See [API reference][4] for more details.
