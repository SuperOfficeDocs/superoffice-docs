# POST Agents/Document/SetDocumentStreamFromId

```http
POST /api/v1/Agents/Document/SetDocumentStreamFromId
```

Store document content from stream.


Since there is a potential for a name conflict (the file name stored by the document entity earlier may prove to be invalid), the (possibly amended) document entity is returned. The client should not assume that any earlier, cached entity information is valid.
