# PUT Document/{id}

```http
PUT /api/v1/Document/{id}
```

Updates the existing DocumentEntity Save the document entity.


If the entity already exists and the file name of the incoming entity is different from the existing one, a corresponding renaming of the physical document will be attempted. This may cause an amended file name to be substituted into the document entity, since a document plugin may have aribitrary rules on file names and collisions. Clients should always inspect the return value from this call and not assume that what they sent for saving is the final truth.
