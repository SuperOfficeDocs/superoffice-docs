# POST Document/{id}/Content

```http
POST /api/v1/Document/{documentId}/Content
```

Create a new physical document based on a document template and store it in the document archive.


Tags are substituted according to the provided id's.  Use GetDocumentStream to obtain the created document content. Since there is a potential for a name conflict (the file name stored by the document entity earlier may prove to be invalid), the (possibly amended) document entity is returned. The client should not assume that any earlier, cached entity information is valid.
