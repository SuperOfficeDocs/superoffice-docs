# PATCH Sale/{id}

```http
PATCH /api/v1/Sale/{id}
```

Update a SaleEntity with changes, as described in a JSON Patch or a JSON Merge Patch document.


See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902">RFC6902</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386">RFC 7396</a>. Update the Department field to "foo" can be done either as a JSON PATCH:

```js

[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/Department", "value": "foo" } ]

```

or as a JSON MERGE PATCH, which describes the change directly:

```js

{ "Department": "foo" }

```



JSON PATCH supports operations 'add', 'replace', 'remove' and 'test'.
The path is case insensitive, and the leading slash is optional, so the paths "/department", "Department" and "department" are all equivalent.



Calls the {SuperOffice.CRM.Services.ISaleAgent} service SaveSaleEntity.
