# Introduction to working with flows through the APIs

A flow is an automated sequence of marketing-related steps, such as sending a message, updating participant information, or creating an activity. For a conceptual overview, see [the Learn - Marketing section][1]. This page details how to create flows using the API.

## Creating an EmailFlow

To create a new flow programmatically:

1. [Create a default `EmailFlow` object][4]: Start with the [CreateDefaultEmailFlow Agent][2] to initialize a new flow.

    ```http
    POST /api/v1/Agents/Workflow/CreateDefaultEmailFlow
    ```

1. [Add triggers][5]: Include triggers (in the `EmailFlow` object) to set conditions for when a person is suggested as participant in the flow.

    ```http
    POST /api/v1/Agents/Workflow/CreateDefaultWorkflowTrigger
    ```

1. [Add steps][6]: Define and incorporate steps (into the `EmailFlow` object) to sequence the flow of actions.

    ```http
    POST /api/v1/Agents/Workflow/CreateDefaultWorkflowStepFromType
    ```

1. [Save the flow][7]: Use the [SaveEmailFlow Agent][3] to finalize and save the configured email flow.

    ```http
    POST /api/v1/Agents/Workflow/SaveEmailFlow
    ```
