# NetServer web service proxies

## WebApi client proxy

[!include[ALT](../../includes/webapi-client-intro.md)]

This library makes it easier to work in a **multi-tenant** environment. It isolates a tenant's context in a **WebApiOptions** instance, where each instance is configured to target one specific tenant. Each instance can be configured with its own language, culture, and timezone settings.

This library also has built-in [system user token][8] support.

## SOAP client proxy

If your services are configured to use SOAP, each method call is a SOAP envelope that will travel over the network. SOAP calls can be made by your preferred client, such as .NET.

There is flexibility in using SuperOffice **proxies**.

**Options:**

* Use NetServer proxies ([NuGet packages][6])
* Generate a [custom proxy][3] by adding a web service

### NetServer proxies

The most complete way is to reference the NuGet packages. You can either:

* [Call in local mode][1]
* [Call in remote mode][2]

### Custom proxies

When necessary, use a tool to generate a client proxy class for a particular NetServer web service, for example, *Appointment.svc* or *Contact.svc*.
