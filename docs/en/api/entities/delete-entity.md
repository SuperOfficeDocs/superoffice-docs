# Delete an Entity

To delete an Entity, we have to use the `Delete()` method of that entity.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting an Entity will not delete any Entities or Rows that are parts of its properties.

```csharp
using SuperOffice.CRM.Entities;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Rows;
using SuperOffice;
using (SoSession mySession = SoSession.Authenticate("SAL0", ""))
{
  //Retrieve an entity
  Sale newSale = Sale.GetFromIdxSaleId(49);

  //Deleting the Entity
  newSale.Delete();

  //Checking whether the entity has been deleted
  if (newSale.IsDeleted == true)
  {
    string test = "The sale has been deleted";
  }
}
```

Before we delete any entity, we have to retrieve it. Once an Entity is retrieved, we can simply use the `Delete()` method and remove that particular Entity from the database.
