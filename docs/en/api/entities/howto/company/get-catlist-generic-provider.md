# Get a CategoryList through generic list providers

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/get-catlist-generic.cs)]

By passing the correct parameters to the `Create` method of the `SoListProviderFactory`, you can create a `CategoryList`. `Create()` has 7 overloads providing a typed, customized interface for each list.

In the example above, we have passed the name of the list needed (category). The way how `RootItems`, `HeadingItems`, and `HistoryItems` are defined is consistent for all the [generic lists][1].

All `RootItems` are taken for the corresponding table, in this case, the  [category table][3]. If the MDO mode of the [CategoryList][2] is turned on, then some records may be present in the [history table][4] corresponding to the category list so that the history list may be nonempty. Similarly, if the [heading table][5] contains records corresponding to the category list, then the `HeadingItems` of the category list will also be nonempty.
