# How to create a recurring appointment (data layer)

This demonstrates the use of [AppointmentMatrix][1] to create [recurring appointments][2]. `SuperOffice.CRM.Entities.AppointmentMatrix` is a matrix holding information about repeating appointments and their attendees.

In the following example, we will be creating an appointment at 2.00 P.M. tomorrow that will recur for the next 8 working days.

## Code

```csharp
using SuperOffice.CRM.Entities;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Rows;
using SuperOffice.CRM.Services;
using SuperOffice.Data;
try
{
  using (SoSession newSession = SoSession.Authenticate("p", "p"))
  {
    // Create an appointment
    Appointment recurringAppointment = Appointment.CreateNew();
    recurringAppointment.SetDefaults();

    // Set the appointment text
    TextRow appointmentText =recurringAppointment.AppointmentText;
    appointmentText.Text = "This is a recurring appointment.";
    recurringAppointment.AppointmentText = appointmentText;

    // Set the appointment contact
    recurringAppointment.Contact = Contact.GetFromIdxContactId(2);

    // Set the appointment type and status
    recurringAppointment.Type = AppointmentType.inDiary;
    recurringAppointment.Status = AppointmentStatus.NotStarted;

    // Set the appointment duration
    DateTime tomorrow = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1);
    DateTime startTime = new DateTime(tomorrow.Year, tomorrow.Month, tomorrow.Day, 14, 00, 00);
    DateTime endTime = startTime.AddHours(1);

    // Date + start time planned
    recurringAppointment.DoBy = startTime;

    // Date + end time planned
    recurringAppointment.EndDate = endTime;

    // Create the Appointment Matrix
    AppointmentMatrix appointmentMatrix = new AppointmentMatrix(recurringAppointment, RecurrenceUpdateMode.ThisAndForward);

    // Set the recurrence information as to every working day for 8 days starting from tomorrow
    RecurrenceInfo recurrenceInfo = appointmentMatrix.Recurrence;
    recurrenceInfo.Pattern = RecurrencePattern.Daily;
    recurrenceInfo.DayPattern = new RecurrenceDayPattern();
    recurrenceInfo.DayPattern.Pattern = RecurrenceDailyPattern.EveryWorkday;
    recurrenceInfo.StartDate = tomorrow;
    recurrenceInfo.EndDate = recurrenceInfo.StartDate.AddDays(8);

    // Calculate the days according the the recurrence pattern
    appointmentMatrix.CalculateDays();
    appointmentMatrix.Recurrence = recurrenceInfo;

    // Save the recurrence matrix
    appointmentMatrix.Save();
  }
}
catch (Exception ss)
{
  Console.WriteLine(ss.Message);
  Console.ReadKey();
}
```

## Walk-through

First, we have created the appointment that should recur, using the `CreateNew` method exposed in the `Appointment` entity. The appointment text is set next, followed by setting the contact, appointment type, and status for the appointment.

Next, we have created the appointment matrix passing the appointment to recur.

In creating recurring appointments the most important part is **setting the recurrence information**. This is done by creating a recurrence pattern. In this example, the pattern is as such the appointment should recur daily for 8 days starting from tomorrow. Thus the recurrence pattern is set to *Daily* and further specified as *EveryWorkday*. The `RecurrencePattern` and `RecurrenceDailyPattern` are enumerations.

Next, we have set the start and end dates for the repetition pattern. Using the `CalculateDays` method the days for the recurrence pattern are created.

Finally, the recurrence information is assigned to the matrix and the matrix is saved to the database.
