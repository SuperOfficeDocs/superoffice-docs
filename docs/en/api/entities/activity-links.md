# Activity links sub-object on models

Appointments, documents, sales can link to each other

The system uses the relation table (originally used only for person/contact relations).

This replaced the old single-value `DocumentLink` property that `Appointment` and `Sale` used to have before SuperOffice 6.

The system uses the relation table to allow many-to-many links between all activities.

![Appointment link -screenshot][img1]

This appointment is saved with `appointment_id = 24`

![x][img2]

To find all the links from this appointment:

```SQL
select * from relations where source_table=9 and source_record=24
```

![x][img3]

These links are all defined by `reldef_id` = 8 (appointment), 9 (document), and 10 (sale), which looks like this:

```SQL
Select * from relationdefinition
```

![x][img4]

> [!NOTE]
> A relationship definition can apply to more than one table.

In this case, the link can be to appointments, documents, or sales:

```SQL
Select * from relationtarget where reldef_id in (8, 9, 10)
```
