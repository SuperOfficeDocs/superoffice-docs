# Selection

Selections are a list of contacts and persons **grouped** based on certain criteria. The selections can be created using the GUI Selections in the SuperOffice CRM interface. In the GUI you can add one or more criteria that you want the selection made out of and the system will find the contacts and persons according to the criteria that you defined.

## Why use selections?

The advantage of using selection is that you donâ€™t need to search for the contacts that you interact with regularly. You can define a selection like the above and then when you go into the selection you can find all the contacts and the persons belonging to them.

Another advantage is you can use the **Task** panel to perform certain tasks on the listed contacts and persons of a selection.

As shown, you can send an email to all the persons listed in the selection, or you can select one or many persons you want to send the email to from the selection member list.

## Different types of selections

* Companies/Contacts
* Sales
* Project
* Follow-ups
* Documents
  * Tasks depending on type and selection
  * Categories of selections
  * Both dynamic and static
  * Always a contact archive
  * Group edit
  * Navigate selection

* Work efficiently with collections of different entities
* "Transforming selections"
* Closer connection between search and selections
* Use selections as an overview and grouping of activities etc
* Power features on groups of entities

## Static or dynamic?

A Selection can be updated either on the fly, called **dynamic**, whereas the rest are called **static**.
