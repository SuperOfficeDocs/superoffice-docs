# How to configure certificates in the Windows certificate store

Let's look at how to configure your certificates in a Windows certificate store. This is necessary to enable your application to validate all SAML and JWT tokens issued by SuperOffice CRM Online.

In this procedure, you will need the 3 SuperOffice [development environment certificates][1]

![x][img1]

You find these in the [certificates download][2]. *SuperOfficeOnline.crt* is stored in the *RootCertificate* folder, the 2 trusted people certificates are stored in the *environment* folder.

This procedure **must be completed on all computers that will be hosting your application in all 3 environments**: [development, stage, and production][3]. If you don't have access to the certificate store, you need to implement a [programmatic override][4] to validate the certificates.

## Import root and environment certificates

**Pre-requisites:**

* you have [added the Certificates snap-in][5]

**To import certificates:**

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Select **Certificates (Local Computer)**.

3. Start the certificate import wizard:

    1. Right-click **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
    2. Point to **All Tasks**
    3. Select **Import**
    4. Click **Next**

## Import subject (login) certificates

**Pre-requisites:**

* you have added the Certificates snap-in
* you have imported the root and environment certificates

**To import subject certificates:**

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Select **Certificates (Local Computer)**.

3. Start the certificate import wizard:

     1. Right-click **Trusted People**
     2. Point to **All Tasks**
     3. Select **Import**
     4. Click **Next**

4. Select *SuperOfficeFederatedLogin.crt* from disk and click **Next**.

## How do I verify that certificates are configured correctly?

On the computer in each hosting environment:

1. Open MMC.
2. Select **Certificates (Local Computer)**.
3. Select the certificates folder of **Trusted People**.
