# OpenID Connect

The OpenID Connect identity provider has multiple endpoints with which the user and client application interact.

OpenID Connect describes a metadata document that contains most of the information required for an app to perform sign-in. This includes all endpoint URLs in use and the location of the service’s public signing keys.

The metadata is a simple JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document and can be found at:

`https://{environment}.superoffice.com/login/.well-known/openid-configuration`

The **environment** subdomain is unique for each [application environment][1]:

## Environment-specific sub-domains

| Environment | Sub-domain |
|-------------|------------|
| Development | sod        |
| Stage       | qaonline   |
| Production  | online     |

## Endpoints

### Authorize endpoint

This is where the user is asked to authenticate and [grant the partner application consent to access][2] their identity. When consent is given, this endpoint passes back an Authorization Code.

Here, the user interacts indirectly with the identity provider through a user agent, such as a browser.

### Tokens endpoint

This endpoint authenticates the client application. It also exchanges the Authorization Code from the authorization endpoint for an [ID token][3], an access token, and a refresh token.

#### Access tokens

**Access tokens** are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API.

The SuperOffice access token is **proprietary** and not a standard JWT. It cannot be inspected with tools such as [jwt.io][8].

The access token is primarily a means to call a target API. It is:

* used as a **credential** when calling the API
* time-limited and needs to be refreshed periodically (3600 seconds / 1 hour)

You will receive the access token in the authorization response. It is up to the application to securely store the access token.

You need to get a new access token when:

* the application user signs in for the 1st time
* the previous token expires

#### Refresh tokens

**Refresh tokens** are used in token-based authentication to get a new access token and ID token when those expire.

The refresh token is sent in a request:

* when the access (or ID) token has expired
* when you want to update the claims in an ID token

The refresh token is only returned in the **authentication code flow**. To read more about how to use a refresh token, visit the [Authorization Code flow][4] section.

### JWKS endpoint

The JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) is a set of keys that contains the public certificate used to verify any JSON web token (JWT) issued by SuperID.

### UserInfo endpoint

**Not supported**, however some OpenID Connect clients allow post-authentication hooks to populate a users profile.

In that case, assuming the hook provides the access_token, one can use the [`v1/User/currentPrincipal`][9] REST endpoint to obtain current users profile details.

**Examples:**

* [NextJS OAuth 2.0 provider][10]
* [AspNet.Security.OAuth.SuperOffice][11]

### End Session endpoint

The end session endpoint can be used to trigger single sign-out (see [spec][6]).

### Revocation endpoint

This endpoint is used to revoke access tokens (reference tokens only) and refresh token.
