# System user flow

The **System User Flow** offers a method for server-to-server communication, eliminating the need for an interactive user login. This approach is pivotal for applications aiming to access data without traditional user constraints.

> [!WARNING]
> The ticket credential from the System User flow should be cached. It is valid for 6 hours, with a sliding expiration each time it is used. Therefore, only obtain a new one when necessary, for example when a request results in a 401 Unauthorized or the cache times out.

To better grasp the process, check out our visual walk-through:

## Key concepts

* **System User**: A distinct user category that empowers an application to seamlessly access data without any limitations.

* **System User Token**: This "magic string" is received as a claim in the `id_token` when an administrative user authenticates your application for the first time.

* **System User Ticket**: This is a credential one receives as a claim in a JWT. It's generated when sending a signed version of the System User Token to the [PartnerSystemUser endpoint][8].

## Getting started

Before delving into the System User flow, ensure you meet these two prerequisites:

1. **Activate the System User Option**: While setting up your application in the [Developer Portal][1], choose the **Server to server** option.

2. **Acquire the System User Token**: An administrator needs to sign in to their tenant via [OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect][10]. Once they approve the application after authentication, the `id_token` claim collection will contain the system user token.

Remember, the system user token:

* Is uniquely formatted: `Application Name-<random-number-of-characters>`.
* Stays constant for each tenant and application combo.
* Will remain unchanged throughout the application's life, unless rescinded by the client or app vendor.

### From Token to Ticket

1. Start by generating a [signed System User token][11].
2. Proceed to [send this signed token][8] to the SuperOffice PartnerSystemUser endpoint.
3. Upon receiving the response, [validate the JSON Web Token (JWT)][3].
4. Derive the Ticket claim from the JWT.

## Implementing the System User Ticket credentials

An application can harness the system user ticket in multiple ways:

* For HTTP requests in the Authorization header:
  * Swap `Authorization Bearer <access_token>` for `Authorization SOTicket <ticket>`.
  * The **SO-AppToken** header *has* to accompany the request, with the value being the OAuth 2.0 client_secret.

* For SOAP API, use the ticket in the **User:Ticket** element, and the client_id in the **User:ApplicationToken** element.

### [REST](#tab/rest)

```http
GET https://sod.superoffice.com/Cust12345/api/v1/User/currentPrincipal HTTP/1.1
Authorization: SOTicket {{ticket}}
SO-AppToken: {{client_secret}}
Accept: application/json
```

### [SOAP](#tab/soap)

See the `<User:Credentials>` and `<User:ApplicationToken>` elements:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
 xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" ...>
  <User:ApplicationToken>{{client_secret}}</User:ApplicationToken>
  <User:Credentials>
    <User:Ticket>{{ticket}}</User:Ticket>
  </User:Credentials>
 <SOAP-ENV:Body>
   <User:GetUser>
    <User:UserId xsi:type="xsd:int">0</User:UserId>
   </User:GetUser>
 </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

Armed with valid credentials, your application is set to send authenticated requests to the desired customer tenant.
