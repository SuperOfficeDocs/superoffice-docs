# Switching between sessions

Sometimes it is necessary to [suspend one session][1] and switch to another. The following example shows how this is done.

```csharp
using SuperOffice;

SoSession newSession = SoSession.Authenticate("SAL0", "");

if (SoContext.CurrentIdentity != null)
{
  MessageBox.Show("Logged on user is : " + SoContext.CurrentIdentity.Name);
}
else
  MessageBox.Show("Pending a Session");

//Suspending the session
string state1 = newSession.Suspend();

if (SoContext.CurrentIdentity == null)
{
  MessageBox.Show("Session is suspended");
}
else
{
  MessageBox.Show("The user " + SoContext.CurrentIdentity.Name + " is not yet suspended");
}

//creating another session
SoSession newSession2 = SoSession.Authenticate("SAL1", "");
if (SoContext.CurrentIdentity != null)
{
  MessageBox.Show("Newly logged-in user is : " + SoContext.CurrentIdentity.Name);
}
else
  MessageBox.Show("Pending new Session");

/*suspend the newly created session. We need to keep the return
value, so that we can resume this session later and close it properly*/
string state2 = newSession2.Suspend();

//continue the former session
newSession = SoSession.Continue(state1);
if (SoContext.CurrentIdentity == null)
{
  MessageBox.Show("Session is still suspended");
}
else
{
  MessageBox.Show("The user " + SoContext.CurrentIdentity.Name + " is Continued");
}
//Close the session
newSession.Close();
```

Here we have first created a session and suspended it. Then we have created another new session. Later the secondly created session is suspended and the former session is continued to show how you may switch between sessions.
