# Reserved words

The following reserved words can't be used in CRMScript as variables, structs, or function names:

* Bool
* break
* catch
* Category
* Company
* continue
* Customer
* Date
* Diary
* else
* Email
* false
* Float
* for
* Generic
* if
* Inbox
* Integer
* Invoice
* License
* Message
* Priority
* return
* String
* struct
* this
* throw
* Ticket
* Time
* true
* try
* User
* Void
* while

You should also avoid using:

* the name of HTML objects and event handlers
* the name of built-in CRMScript classes and functions (can't be redefined or used by you)

## Future compatibility

Avoid all standard programming language reserved words.
This can save you from having to re-write your code as CRMScript evolves.
