# Data types

An in-depth guide to CRMScript data types.

Let's recap the fundamentals:

A data type tells the computer what something **is** so that it can be processed properly.
CRMScript has 4 primitive data types and a huge range of complex types defined by the built-in classes.

The CRMScript language is **statically typed**, meaning you *must* set the type in the declaration, and it can't be changed later.
