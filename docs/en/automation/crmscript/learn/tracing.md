# Tracing

The tracing feature records every detail in the execution of a script or macro and save it in a log. Every time the script or macro is used, the execution is recorded.

You can then investigate the script execution by rewinding and fast-forwarding through the recording. You get a full list of all the recorded executions of the script, and by whom the script was executed. This allows you to see how your scripts behaved and see all the variables at any given point.
