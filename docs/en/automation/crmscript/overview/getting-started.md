# Getting started with CRMScript

When you are ready to start learning CRMScript:

* Explore the topics in the [Fundamentals][1] section. Try out the interactive script snippets for yourself. You can modify the code and run it to see the effects.

* Familiarize yourself with the [simple data types][2].

* Adopt our [coding conventions][3] and [best practices][4].

* Learn about error handling and [debugging][5].

* Ask your questions in the [!include[forums](includes/link-forum-cs.md)].

* [Register as a developer][8] to get access to your own sandbox environment and start exploring interaction with SuperOffice.

To develop applications and scripts in our SOD environment is free. [Required licenses][7] apply only in production (live).
