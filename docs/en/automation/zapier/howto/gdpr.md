# How to maintain GDPR configuration

When you create new contacts in SuperOffice CRM, you can choose different options for the following [GDPR consent fields][1]:

* Consent purpose name
* Consent source
* Consent comment
* E-Marketing subscription types (with multi select, can add several subscription types)

If you do not provide a value for one or more of the consent fields, default values are used when a new contact is created.
