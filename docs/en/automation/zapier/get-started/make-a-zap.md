1. Here you have an option to **pull in sample** data from your **SuperOffice Online installation**, or to **Skip this step** by using a predefined **sample example** from the application.

    This sample will also be used when you set up the Action of the Zap

1. The **sample** is shown, and by clicking the **arrow** you can see more information in the sample text.

    In this example, **Skip This Step** was chosen, and you can keep on using that sample by clicking the button for **Continue With Default Sample**.

    Alternatively, you can click the **Pull In My Sample**, and then get the sample from your SuperOffice Online installation.

1. Click the button for **Continue With Default Sample** to finish the step. 

    You are now finished with the **Trigger** step and can continue to the **Action** step that you have chosen.
