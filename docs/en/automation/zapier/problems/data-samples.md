# Problems when pulling in data samples

![Issue connecting Zapier to SuperOffice][img1]

If you are unable to connect and pull data samples from SuperOffice, the likely reason is that the account you are using do not have the necessary administrator access rights. This requirement to have sufficient administrator rights to approve a connection is due to security reasons, i.e. that the account has enough user rights to use triggers, actions and search.

Workaround: Try using a different account with more user rights when you connect to SuperOffice installation.

Remember that Zaps can do a lot of “damage” to you SuperOffice CRM for example by adding a lot of duplicate information, and this is something we aim to prevent from happening.
