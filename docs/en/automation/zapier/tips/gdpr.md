# How to maintain GDPR configuration

![Create new contact information][img1]

When you create new contacts in SuperOffice CRM, you can choose different options for the following GDPR consent fields:

  * Consent purpose name

  * Consent source

  * Consent comment

  * E-Marketing subscription types (with multi select, can add several subscription types)

If you do not add anything in these fields, the default values on **Consent purpose name**, **Consent source** and **Consent comment** (see the help text) will be set automatically when a new contact is created.
