# Finding/updating contact, company or sale in SuperOffice

There will always be a risk of creating duplicates of companies and contacts. To avoid duplicates, you can create a step for Search before you put in the Action to create/update an entity in SuperOffice CRM:

* Find Sale

* [Find Company](find-company.md)

* Find Contact

* Find Request

* Find Project

[Find Company](find-company.md)

[Use the Find result in the Action](find-company.md)
