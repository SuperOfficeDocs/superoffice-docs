# Create documents

To add a document to SuperOffice Service, you must first create the document itself. To create a price list, you could, for example, use Microsoft Word or Excel to write the contents and add it to SuperOffice Service.

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Documents**.

2. Go to the folder you want to put the document in. If it does not yet exist, you can [create a new folder][1].

3. Click the **New document** button. This takes you to the **Document properties** screen.

4. Enter a descriptive name for the document in the **Name** field.

5. The **In folder** field automatically shows the name of the folder you chose. If you change your mind, you can click the list button (![icon][img1]) and select a different folder in the list that appears.

6. In the **Access** field, select who is to have access to read and edit the document.

7. To use the document in a web-based customer centre, you can add a unique ID string in the **ID string** field.

8. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what the document contains.

9. Click the **Choose file** button next to **File**, and select the new document in the dialog that appears.

10. Click **Save**. If the document type can be edited in the browser, the **Contents** field is populated with the document contents.

11. Click **OK**. The document is added to the specified folder under **Documents**.
