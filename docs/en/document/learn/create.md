# Create new document

> [!TIP]
> Already have the document? See [Upload documents](#upload).

Follow the instructions below, depending on how documents are managed in your SuperOffice installation.

## How do I know if I am using SharePoint, SuperOffice WebTools, or not?

[!include[How to check document library](includes/webtools-or-sharepoint.md)]

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD051 -->
## Steps

### [Using SuperOffice WebTools](#tab/webtools)

With SuperOffice CRM, you can log in from any PC using a browser, but your documents will then be saved on the central server. Downloading and uploading of documents are handled automatically by SuperOffice WebTools.

1. Click **New** > **Document** on the top bar.

2. [Enter the required information in the fields.](#fields)

3. Click the **Create** button to create a new document based on the selected [document template][5]. The **Document** dialog closes automatically, and the document opens in your default text-editing application.

4. Type in the content of your document.

5. Save it and close the text-editing application. The document is saved.

### [Using SharePoint Documents](#tab/sharepoint)

**This feature requires a license.**

1. Click **New** > **Document** on the top bar.

2. [Enter the required information in the fields.](#fields)

3. Click the **Create** button to create a new document based on the selected [document template][5]. The document is created in SharePoint and opened in a new tab with the online text-editing application (Office Online).

    To use your desktop editing program, you can choose **Open in Desktop App** from Office Online.

4. Type in the contents of the document.

5. Close the tab or your desktop app. The document is automatically saved to SharePoint.

### [Without WebTools](#tab/no-webtools)

If you have not installed SuperOffice WebTools, you must manually download documents to edit them. Afterwards, you must upload the edited documents to the central server.

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure describes how to create new documents if you are using a desktop text-editing application. The actual process may be slightly different if you use an online text-editing tool (like Microsoft 365) and a document library (like SharePoint).

1. Click **New** > **Document** on the top bar.

2. [Enter the required information in the fields.](#fields)

3. Click the **Create** button to create a new document based on the selected [document template][5]. The document is created on the server.

4. Click **Open** and **Edit**.

5. In the **File download** dialog, select one of the following buttons:

    * **Open:** When you click **Open**, the document is opened in the text editing application. Type in the contents of the document and select **File** > **Save As** to save it in the desired location on your PC.

    * **Save:** When you click **Save**, the **Save As** dialog appears. Specify where on the PC you want to save the file, and then click **Save** to start the download. Click **Close** when the download is finished. Open Windows Explorer and browse to the document you have just saved. Open the document, enter the required text and save the document.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Changes to the document are not saved in SuperOffice automatically. If you want such behavior, we recommend [installing SuperOffice WebTools][7].

6. Close the text-editing program.

7. Go to the **Document** dialog.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If **Completed** is checked, the upload options are disabled. In that case, remove the checkmark.

8. Click the link to upload the document or drag and drop the document from Windows Explorer to the **Document** dialog.
