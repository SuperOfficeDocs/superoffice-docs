# Edit documents

Editing documents involves two things:

* Editing of the document properties in the **Document** dialog.
* Editing of the document file itself in the application the document was created in.

You can open a document in [edit mode or in read mode][1]. When you open the document in edit mode, only you can edit the document. Other users can open the document in read mode. If your organization uses a document library like SharePoint, multiple people can edit a document simultaneously.

## Edit document properties in the Document dialog

To change document properties, such the project the document is linked to, use the **Document** dialog:

1. Select the required document.

2. Right-click and select **Document**. If you double-click on the document, it opens directly in the application it was created in.

3. [Make the required changes][3].

4. Click the **Save** button.

> [!NOTE]
> To edit a completed document, you must first uncheck the **Completed** status.

## Edit document content

Follow the instructions below, depending on how documents are managed in your SuperOffice installation.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD051 -->
### [Using SuperOffice WebTools](#tab/webtools)

1. Double-click the required document.

1. If a dialog opens, click **Edit**.

1. Update the document as required.

1. Save it and close the text-editing application.

1. (if applicable) In the dialog that appears, click **Yes** if you are done editing the document. Click **No** to keep the document checked out.

    This dialog appears only if this option was activated in SuperOffice WebTools.

1. The document is checked in and the status is set to **Completed**.

### [Using SharePoint Documents](#tab/sharepoint)

**This feature requires a license.**

1. Double-click the required document. The document opens in a new tab with the online text-editing program (Office Online).

    To use your desktop editing program, you can choose **Open in Desktop App** from Office Online.

2. Edit the document.

3. Close the tab or your desktop app. The document is automatically saved to SharePoint.

### [Without WebTools](#tab/no-webtools)

This procedure describes how to edit a document if you are using a desktop text-editing application. The actual process may be slightly different if you use an online text-editing tool (like Microsoft Office Online) and a document library (like SharePoint).

1. Double-click the required document.

2. In the **Document** dialog, click **Open**.

3. If a dialog opens, click **Edit**.

4. In the **File download** dialog, select **Open** or **Save** Then, follow steps 5-9 from the [create document without WebTools][2] procedure.

## <a id="allow"></a>Browser security question for opening files

When you access and edit a document, file, or email in SuperOffice, your browser prompts you with a *security question* regarding the file download.

* To open the file, you must select the **Open**/**Allow** button.
* Select **Always allow** to skip the question next time.

The dialog is slightly different in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.

**Chrome:** Select **Open URL:SuperOffice-Extensions**.

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete document

### From the Activities section tab

1. Select the required document on the **Activities** section tab in the Company, Contact, Diary, Sale, or Project screen.

1. Right-click and choose **Delete**.

1. Confirm or cancel the deletion in the confirmation dialog.

### From the Document dialog

When viewing a specific document:

1. Click the **Task** button in the **Document** dialog.
2. Choose **Delete**.
3. Confirm or cancel the deletion in the confirmation dialog.

## Troubleshooting

If you double-click a document and nothing happens, try to right-click it and select **Document**. This opens the **Document** dialog. Click **Open** and see if the document opens now.
