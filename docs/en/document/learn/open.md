# Open documents

You can open and view exiting documents from the following locations:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
[!include[List of Activities section tabs](../../learn/includes/list-activities-section-tabs.md)]
* The **Documents** section tab in the **Selection** screen, if a document selection is active.
* The search results in the **Document** tab in the **Find** screen.
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

You can open a document in [edit mode or in read mode][1]. When you open the document in edit mode, only you can edit the document. Other users can open the document in read mode.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization uses a document library like SharePoint, multiple people can edit a document simultaneously.

The document is opened in the program it was created in.

The procedure depends on how documents are managed in your SuperOffice installation. See [Edit documents][2].
