# Send a document as email

1. Go to the **New email** dialog in one of the following ways:
    * From the Activities section tab:
        1. Select one or more documents on the **Activities** section tab in the **Company**, **Contact**, **Diary**, **Sale** or **Project** screens.
        2. Right-click and select **Send as email**.
    * From the Document dialog
        1. Open the document in **Edit** mode.
        2. Click the **Task** button.
        3. Select **Send as email**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You can send only one document at a time in this fashion. To send several documents at once, select the documents in the **Activities** section tab.

    <details><summary>Is a dialog entitled Select email address displayed?</summary>

    If the dialog is displayed:

    1. Choose the company to send the document to in the company field. By default the company that is active in the **Company** screen is shown. Here you can also use [FastSearcher][1] or [The History list][2]. Once you have chosen a company, their email address is displayed next to the company field.

    2. To send it to a specific person in the company, choose from the available alternatives in the list box for contacts. Once you have chosen a contact, their email address is displayed next to the list box for contacts.

    3. Under **Selected email address** there is now displayed the email address or correctly-formatted fax number for the selected company (or contact if you specified one). To send to a different email address or fax number, enter that here.
    4. Click **Next** to send the document.
    </details>

2. An empty message opens in the **New email** dialog:

    * The email address of the addressee of the document is displayed by default in the **To** field.
    * The document heading is displayed in the **Subject** field of the email.
    * The document itself is attached to the message as an ordinary email attachment.
    * Type in a message to the recipient if required. Optionally, change the recipient.
