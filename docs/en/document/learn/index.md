# Document <i class="ph ph-files" aria-hidden="true"></i>

Storing all documents in one place helps you and your team to access up-to-date information and stay in control of customer relations.

Documents can be letters, quotations or memos, and they can be displayed in several places in SuperOffice CRM.

> [!TIP]
> To open and examine an existing document, double-click it in the **Activities** section tab or in a document selection. The document is opened in the program it was created in.

You can open a document in [edit mode or in read mode][7]. When you open the document in edit mode, only you can edit the document. Other users can open the document in read mode. If your organization uses a document library like SharePoint, multiple people can edit a document simultaneously.

## Create new

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create or upload a document by clicking **New** on the top bar and then select **Document**.

## Locate your documents

* The **Activities** section tab in the Diary screen shows all uncompleted documents plus those marked as completed after you last logged in to SuperOffice CRM.

* The **Activities** section tab in the Company, Contact, Sale, and Project screen shows all documents linked to the current record.

* The **Documents** tab in the Selection screen shows all documents within the current selection (if it is a document selection).

## Add record as a favorite

To add a record to favorites, click <i class="ph ph-star" aria-label="Star icon"></i> in the corner of the relevant card, tab or dialog. The star turns yellow, and the record is instantly added to favorites. You do not have to click **Save**.

## Standardize your documents

When working with customers, there are often documents that you create and send out repeatedly. Usually they contain the same basic elements, but different content. By creating your own [templates][11], you can be certain that the documents your employees create all look the same.

You can add any type of document template to SuperOffice CRM, whether it is a contract, a quotation, a project description, or your own version of the Privacy confirmation email.

Creating templates for frequently used documents and making them available for everyone will save your CRM users' time and ensure the unified look across your organization.

In SuperOffice CRM, you can easily create document templates for Word, Email, Excel, PowerPoint and other file types.
