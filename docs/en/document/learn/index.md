No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create or upload a new document by clicking **New** on the top bar and selecting **Document**. You can also create and upload new documents from the **New** button in the Top bar.

Documents can be letters, quotations or memos, and they can be displayed in several places in SuperOffice CRM.

| Company | Activities | All documents linked to the active company |
| Contact | Activities | All documents linked to the active contact |
| Sale | Activities | All documents linked to the active sale |
| Project | Activities | All documents linked to the active project |
| Diary | Activities | All uncompleted documents plus those marked as completed since you last logged in to SuperOffice CRM. |

## How SuperOffice CRM selects the correct language template

In SuperOffice CRM, you will find multiple default templates. These are available in 12-16 languages depending on the template type. This includes email templates and GDPR templates (12 languages).

To ensure that you can communicate with your clients in their own language (where possible), SuperOffice CRM will automatically perform a language check to determine which language temple to use. Relevant when sending out invitation emails, and when notifying new contacts that their details were saved. For GDPR related communication, this is also an requirement.

**Steps:**

1. Check if a preferred language is set for the contact, and check if a template is available in this language.
2. Check if the contact's country can be mapped to a corresponding language.
3. Check the preferred document language for the logged-in user, and check if a template is available in this language.
4. Check the user interface language for the logged-in user, and check if a template is available in this language.
5. If no language is found, the English template is used.
