# Sales template variables

You will always find a list of template variables when you click **Help** in SuperOffice.

However, when we push new releases there may be new template variables added that will not be available in the user guide yet. [This page is where it is first updated.][1]

If you encounter a problem with templates check [Document templates troubleshooting][2].
