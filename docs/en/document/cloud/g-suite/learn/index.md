# Enable Google Workspace integration

The free Google Workspace integration app for documents enables you to work effortlessly with documents from SuperOffice CRM.

The Google Workspace app (previously called Google G Suite integration) integrates Workspace's document management function with SuperOffice CRM, so that you can create, store, and find documents in SuperOffice CRM.

The app also enables the single sign-on that allows you to sign in to SuperOffice CRM using your Google Workspace login details.

## Get started

To start using the integration, you need to take 2 set-up steps:

* Set up Google Workspace to integrate to SuperOffice CRM Online.

* Configure the document templates for use, as documented in the article "Configure - Cloud Office document handling".

> [!NOTE]
> You may need administrative rights to SuperOffice CRM, depending on your organization's security settings, in order to make systems connections.
