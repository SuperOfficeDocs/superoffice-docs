# How to set up Microsoft 365 SharePoint

The set-up of the SharePoint site and document libraries is quite flexible, but we recommend to create a separate SharePoint site for your SuperOffice documents, and 2 document libraries: one for documents and a separate document library for templates.

## <a id="step-1" />Step 1 - Create a SharePoint site in your Microsoft 365 SharePoint

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to use **Visible for** (confidentiality), we recommend to set up the SharePoint site with a Microsoft 365 "service user", to avoid normal users (personal) / SuperOffice users do not have owner-rights.
>
> See the [reference of permissions in SharePoint​][1] for more information.

1. Go to SharePoint.
1. Follow the instructions in Microsoft Learn on how to [create a site in SharePoint][2].
1. Choose **Team site** as the type of site you would like to create.
1. If you plan to use **Visible for**, you should use **Private** for privacy settings.

## <a id="step-2" />Step 2 - Create library for documents in SharePoint site

1. Open the site you created in step 1.
