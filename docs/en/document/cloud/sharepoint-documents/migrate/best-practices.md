# Best practices

1. Preparations. Read the [requirements][1] carefully.
2. Run a test migration of a few documents.
3. Analyze the report (send it to SuperOffice R&D and receive guidance from us).
4. Correct issues and complete preparations.
5. Run migration.
6. Adjust and re-run documents that failed.

## Plan ahead

Before initiating the migration process, carefully plan the structure of your SharePoint document library. Consider creating folders, organizing documents by category or department, and defining permissions for different user groups.

## Clean up and organize

Take the opportunity to de-clutter and organize your documents before migrating them. Remove any unnecessary or outdated files, ensuring that only relevant and valuable documents are transferred to SharePoint.

Especially for old documents, it might be cumbersome to plan for all eventualities and make all necessary preparations up front. This will result in error-situations and unplanned events, which then lead to some documents failing on the first run.

## Test and validate

Before migrating all your documents, perform a test migration with a small sample set. This allows you to validate the migration process, ensure that the documents are transferred correctly, and identify any potential issues or errors.

Set aside time for corrections and re-runs.

## Communicate and train

Inform your team members about the upcoming migration and provide them with the necessary training to effectively use SharePoint. Conduct workshops or webinars to educate users on SharePoint's features and functionalities.
