# SharePoint document library integration

SuperOffice's SharePoint document library integration lets you create, archive, and share documents and emails effortlessly and securely.

This integration allows you to store all documents and emails in SharePoint Online, where they can be accessed by everyone in the company, including even those who do not use SuperOffice CRM. The access to your SuperOffice document site in SharePoint can be controlled through Microsoft Entra domain groups (formerly Azure Active Directory).

## Requirements

To set up SharePoint as your document library in SuperOffice, you need:

* SuperOffice Online tenant
  * [Microsoft Entra authentication of SO Admin][1]
* Microsoft 365 for business subscription
  * If you do not have a Microsoft 365 subscription, you have to sign up for one at Microsoft
* A SharePoint document library (for storing documents)
* If you want to enable group access on SharePoint documents based on "Visible for" settings in SuperOffice
  * Need access to 'Global Admin' rights in Microsoft 365 (to be able to authenticate SuperOffice as a trusted app in your Microsoft 365 solution). Either during setup or send a link to someone who is.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have a Microsoft 365 subscription and are unable to sign up for one, you can use the default SuperOffice document library, and each user have to install WebTools for Windows or macOS.
