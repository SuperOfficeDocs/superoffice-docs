# SharePoint documents

## What is SharePoint documents?

Open, edit, and store documents in Microsoft 365 SharePoint directly from SuperOffice.

All documents you write or archive from SuperOffice will be stored in your SharePoint Online repository, where you have total control forever. These documents can also be accessed by everyone in your company. Even those who do not use SuperOffice.

Activating **SharePoint Online Documents** makes SharePoint Online the preferred document repository for all your documents.

A self-service UI to provision and configure SharePoint as SO repository from SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance.

## Benefits

* Run SuperOffice as a SaaS solution without any need of locally-installed software on a client computer.
  * No need to deploy WebTools/OML to users.

* Enable true document collaboration.
  * All Microsoft 365 features are available as normal.
  * Be able to work together in the same document at the same time.
  * Be able to share documents with anyone and have access to older versions of the document at any time.

* As a SuperOffice user, you don't have to think about where the documents are located.
  * Make SuperOffice documents available as any other document in SharePoint.
  * Sharing, revision history and other MS 365 features made available.

* Work with SuperOffice documents from any device.

* Advanced data access options (Visible for...)
  * Visible for me - private in SharePoint
  * Visible for all - default access rights from SharePoint
  * Visible for group - private in SharePoint

## Things to consider

* Backup of documents - this is now no longer managed by SuperOffice - evaluation is required if the current backup schedule of SharePoint fits well.

* Availability of documents - when documents are stored in SuperOffice, they are only available in the front-end client as the SO_ARC folder is unavailable to users. In SharePoint, the document libraries are accessible and therefore this may be considered a disadvantage by some customers.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You need **Global Admin** rights in Microsoft 365 to be able to authenticate SuperOffice as a trusted app in your Microsoft 365 solution.
