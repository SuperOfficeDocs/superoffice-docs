# SharePoint documents

In today's digital age, effective document management is essential for businesses to streamline their operations and enhance collaboration among team members.

## What is SharePoint documents?

Open, edit, and store documents in Microsoft 365 SharePoint directly from SuperOffice.

All documents you write or archive from SuperOffice will be stored in your SharePoint Online repository, where you have total control forever. These documents can also be accessed by everyone in your company. Even those who do not use SuperOffice.

Activating **SharePoint Online Documents** makes SharePoint Online the preferred document repository for all your documents.

A self-service UI to provision and configure SharePoint as SO repository from SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

## Benefits

* Run SuperOffice as a SaaS solution without any need of locally-installed software on a client computer.
  * No need to deploy WebTools/OML to users.

* Enable true document collaboration.
  * All Microsoft 365 features are available as normal.
  * Be able to work together in the same document at the same time.
  * Be able to share documents with anyone and have access to older versions of the document at any time.

* As a SuperOffice user, you don't have to think about where the documents are located.
  * Make SuperOffice documents available as any other document in SharePoint.
  * Sharing, revision history and other MS 365 features made available.

* Work with SuperOffice documents from any device.

* Advanced data access options (Visible for...)

## Things to consider

### Backup

> [!NOTE]
> With SharePoint as your document library, SuperOffice no longer handles backup of documents
>
> Microsoft SharePoint Online has a different backup regime than SuperOffice CRM Online have!

As a platform, Microsoft 365 is secure, but your data is not backed up in a way that most organizations require. Typically, there's only a 30-day retention period built into Microsoft 365. Microsoft SharePoint Online is backed up only every 12 hours, with just a 14-day retention period.

> "SharePoint Online retains backups of all content for 14 additional days beyond actual deletion. If content cannot be restored via the Recycle Bin or Files Restore, an administrator can contact Microsoft Support to request a restore any time inside the 14 day window. Microsoft 365 backs up your SharePoint site every 12 hours."

*[Microsoft online documentation (technet.microsoft.com)][20]*

### Availability

When documents are stored in SuperOffice, they are available only in the front-end client as the SO_ARC folder is unavailable to users. In SharePoint, the document libraries are accessible and therefore this may be considered a disadvantage by some customers.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You need **Global Admin** rights in Microsoft 365 to be able to authenticate SuperOffice as a trusted app in your Microsoft 365 solution.
