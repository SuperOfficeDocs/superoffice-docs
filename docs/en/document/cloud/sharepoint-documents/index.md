# SharePoint documents

## What is SharePoint documents?

Open, edit, and store documents in Microsoft 365 SharePoint directly from SuperOffice.

All documents you write or archive from SuperOffice will be stored in your SharePoint Online repository, where you have total control forever. These documents can also be accessed by everyone in your company. Even those who do not use SuperOffice.

Activating **SharePoint Online Documents** makes SharePoint Online the preferred document repository for all your documents.
