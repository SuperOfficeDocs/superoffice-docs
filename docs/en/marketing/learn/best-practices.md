# Best practices

* Use standard fonts for the best legibility with any email client or web browser.
* To avoid empty variables in your mailings, make sure to [preview the mailing][4] first.

## Checklist for marketing campaign

* Obtain explicit consent from your existing and potential contacts to receive marketing communication from your company. One way of asking for a permission is via mailings or web forms. Seeking permission and storing a record of it are the cornerstones of the GDPR.

* [Document any consents you obtain][5] regarding the lawful storage of personal data and sending e-marketing messages.

* Offer a simple and straight-forward way for your contacts to opt-out of your email marketing campaigns, by including clearly visible [unsubscribe links][3] in your mailings. Another way to make sure you contact only the people that want to hear from you is by creating a subscription management centre where data subjects can choose the content they want to receive.

* Obtain re-permissions from your existing customer base. This means that if you are not sure whether or not you have the necessary permissions, and if you have not provided your contacts with the possibility to opt-out, it may be necessary to obtain re-permissions. Sending a "re-permission" campaign is also a great away to update your existing records.
