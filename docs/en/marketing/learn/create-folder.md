# How to create a folder

It is always a good idea to define a well-organized folder structure to get a better overview of your mailings, forms, templates, links and images in SuperOffice Marketing.

You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate mailings, forms, templates, links and images in each of these folders.

**Steps:**

1. Select one of the main tabs in SuperOffice Marketing.

2. Optional: Open an existing folder to create a sub-folder. You may have to click the **All ...** button first.

3. Click the **Add folder** button ![icon][img1] . The **Folder properties** dialog appears.

4. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.

5. Click **OK**. If the folder does not display in the list, click the **My ...** or **All ...** button.
