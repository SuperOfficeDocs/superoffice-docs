# How to create a folder

It is always a good idea to define a well-organized folder structure to get a better overview of your mailings, forms, flows, templates, links and images in SuperOffice Marketing.

## Steps

1. Select one of the main tabs in SuperOffice Marketing.

2. Click the **Add folder** button.

3. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.

4. Click **OK**. If the new folder does not appear in the list, select the **My ...** or **All ...** tab.

## Sub-folders

You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate marketing material in each of these folders.

Do one of the following:

* Open an existing folder before you click **Add folder**. You may have to select the **All ...** tab first.

* First, click **Add folder** and then select a parent folder from the **Create as subfolder of** list.
