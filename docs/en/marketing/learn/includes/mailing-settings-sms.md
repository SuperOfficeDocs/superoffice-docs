* **Module**: Select the SMS provider you have a contract with for sending SMS from SuperOffice Service.

* **Default country code**: Enter a default country code for the country you are in. For example, +44 for the UK. This country code is used for mobile telephony. It is used for outbound SMS (for example, when you don't enter the country code of the mobile phone number you are sending to) and inbound SMS (so that SuperOffice Service can recognize the customer).

* **Sender**: Enter the sender of the SMS messages. This text will appear on the recipient's mobile phone.

* **Plugin configuration**: Enter (or paste in) the configuration for the selected module (received from your SMS provider).
