# SuperOffice Marketing

SuperOffice Marketing is concerned with outbound communication and forms. Use mailings to inform customers about upgrades or product news, for example. Use forms for product/newsletter registration, consent management, data updates and simple "contact me" forms.

To open SuperOffice Marketing, click the **Marketing** icon ![icon][img2] in the Navigator.

Using SuperOffice Marketing you can create the following:

* **Mailings** (emails, SMS, documents and form responses). [Get started with your first mailing][5].
* **Forms**. [Get started on your first form][1].

## About mailings

You can create the following mailings:

* Emails to all or parts of your customer base
* SMS messages to all or parts of your customer base by mobile phone
* Merged documents (PDFs) to print and send by regular mail to all or parts of your customer base
* Form responses to customers or prospects that submit a form via your website or customer centre

> [!NOTE]
> Email mailings (and form responses) are the most feature-rich of these mailing types. Features such as tracked links and subscription links are not available in SMS mailings and document mailings. SMS mailings can only contain plain text (no images or tables).

The messages you send out can be customized for each customer using [template variables][2]. Add links to your mailings, and add [actions][3] to these links to automate your marketing workflow.

SuperOffice Marketing also deals with what happens after the mailing. You can get instant feedback on the success of the mailing: you can see how many and which customers received and opened the mailing, you can see data on click frequency and see which mailings led to sales.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also initiate a mail merge from the selection screen in SuperOffice CRM.

## Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> Tracked links and reporting features require the Marketing User licence. You also need functional rights to edit and send mailings.

SMS mailing is not available if you are using CRM Online.

## Differences between onsite and online installations

SuperOffice Marketing is available as an online application (cloud-based) and as an onsite application (installed on the customer's premises). There are minor differences between the two. Specific functional differences are indicated by the icons in the procedures themselves or in topic titles.
