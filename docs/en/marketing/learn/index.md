# SuperOffice Marketing

SuperOffice Marketing is concerned with outbound communication and forms. Use mailings to inform customers about upgrades or product news, for example. Use forms for product/newsletter registration, consent management, data updates and simple "contact me" forms.

To open SuperOffice Marketing, click the **Marketing** icon ![icon][img2] in the Navigator.

Using SuperOffice Marketing you can create the following:

* **Mailings** (emails, SMS, documents and form responses). [Get started with your first mailing][5].
* **Forms**. [Get started on your first form][1].

## About mailings

You can create the following mailings:

* Emails to all or parts of your customer base
* SMS messages to all or parts of your customer base by mobile phone
* Merged documents (PDFs) to print and send by regular mail to all or parts of your customer base
* Form responses to customers or prospects that submit a form via your website or customer centre

> [!NOTE]
> Email mailings (and form responses) are the most feature-rich of these mailing types. Features such as [tracked links][11] and [subscription links][10] are not available in SMS mailings and document mailings. SMS mailings can only contain plain text (no images or tables).

The messages you send out can be customized for each customer using [template variables][2]. Add links to your mailings, and add [actions][3] to these links to automate your marketing workflow.

SuperOffice Marketing also deals with what happens after the mailing. You can get instant feedback on the success of the mailing: you can see how many and which customers received and opened the mailing, you can see data on click frequency and see which mailings led to sales.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also initiate a mail merge from the Selection screen.

## GDPR features in Marketing

To achieve maximum success with your marketing activities you need to make sure you stay GDPR-compliant when addressing your customers and prospects.

Following the GDPR requirements is not an option, it is a law. Therefore, you need a system that helps you respect your customers' privacy and stay GDPR-compliant in all your marketing activities.

There are three key areas in which the GDPR affects the work of marketeers:

* **Data permission:** Data permission is about how you manage email opt-ins – people who request to receive promotional material from you. Under the GDPR, people need to give you their consent, before you can send them anything or contact them.

* **Data access:** The GDPR gives people more control over how their personal data is collected and used. This includes that they should have the ability to access or remove information. As a marketeer, it is your responsibility to make sure that your prospects and customers can easily access their data and remove consent if they want to.

* **Data focus:** You should always be able to legally justify the way you process the personal data you collect. So, only collect the information you really need to do your job.

* [GDPR and privacy][7]
* [Manage email subscriptions][8]
* [Send a privacy email for your contacts right to be informed][9]

## Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> Tracked links and reporting features require the Marketing User licence. You also need functional rights to edit and send mailings.

## Necessary skills

To benefit from SuperOffice marketing features, you need a basic understanding of how to register basic CRM data, such as categories on company and contacts, interests and subscription types on contacts (read more about GDPR and privacy), and how to use selections. These steps of registering data help you segment your customer base and create an effective target list. If you want to know how to configure marketing related functions, please see the section for Manage lists in Settings and maintenance.

## Differences between onsite and online installations

SuperOffice Marketing is offered as an online application (cloud-based) and as an onsite application (installed on the customer's premises). There are minor differences between the two. Specific functional differences are indicated by the icons in the procedures themselves or in topic titles.
