# Customise the message for display on mobile devices

The message is automatically customised for display on smaller screens.

Click ![icon][img1] **Mobile** in the global menu to see what the appearance is like on a smart phone. You can also click a section in the message and click ![icon][img1] **Mobile** under **Content** in the side-panel.

To adjust mobile-specific settings for a message, select a section in the message and click **Mobile** in the side-panel. You can now define the formatting for displaying the message on mobile devices, and also select which elements (such as images) to exclude from mobile devices.
