# Add merge tags to your message

There is nothing better than a personal touch in business. To personalize your communication, you can use merge tags (also called template variables) to insert customer-specific information into your mailing.

Merge tags come in many forms: those might be the customer's first name, their company name, salutation, the name of the salesperson the customer was dealing with, etc. In other words, merge tags are your easy-to-use tools to personalize the content for each individual customer.
