# Add a link to display the message in a browser

If the recipient has problems displaying the message in their email program (maybe images aren't displayed, for example), or prefers to read the message in a browser, you can add a link to display the message as a web page. Links of this type are normally placed at the top of the message.

1. Go to the contents of the message and click the section where you want to insert the link.

2. Type and select the text which the recipient has to click, for example "Click here to view this message in a browser".

3. Click the **Insert/edit link** button (![icon][img1])in the toolbar.

4. Click **Special links** and select **Link for viewing message online**.

5. Click **Save**. The link is inserted in the message.
