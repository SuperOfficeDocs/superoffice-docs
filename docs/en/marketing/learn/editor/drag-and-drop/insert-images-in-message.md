# Insert images in the message

Create a stylish mailing using images. You can add images from the SuperOffice database, upload your own images, or use images from a royalty-free online image library.

## How to set an image as background

1. Click a row in the message.
2. In the side-panel, scroll down to **Row properties** and **Background image**.
3. Click **Upload image**.
4. In the **Image library** window, follow one of the procedures below.

## Using an image from the SuperOffice database

1. Go to the **Content** screen in the mailing, or open a template for editing.

2. Select **Content** (![icon][img1]) in the side-panel.

3. Click and drag the **Image** block (![icon][img1]) to the relevant section in the message. You must now select the image to use.

4. Click the block in the message.

5. Click **Upload Image** in the side-panel.

6. In the **Image library** window, select one of the available images or click **Add** to [choose an image file on your PC][1].

7. Click the image in the message and make any necessary changes in the side-panel. Check that the image is correctly displayed and adjust as necessary.

    > [!TIP]
    > For additional image editing options, click **Apply Effects & More**.

8. (optional) [Add a tracked link][2] to the image. For example, if you are inserting a picture of a product you are launching, you can add a link to an information page for the product. You can create a new link or add an existing link.

    To add a regular link (untracked): Select the image, and enter the link in the **URL** field.

## Using an image in the online image library (royalty-free)
