# Customize the message for display on mobile devices

The message is automatically customized for display on smaller screens.

Click **Mobile** ( ![icon][img1] ) in the global menu to see what the appearance is like on a smart phone. You can also click a section in the message and click **Mobile** ( ![icon][img1] ) under **Content** in the side-panel.

To adjust mobile-specific settings for a message, select a section in the message and click **Mobile** in the side-panel. You can now define the formatting for displaying the message on mobile devices, and also select which elements (such as images) to exclude from mobile devices.
