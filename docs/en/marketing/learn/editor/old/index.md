# The old editor

In the **Content** step you can edit the appearance and content of the message.

![Old editor -screenshot][img1]

A message is made up of columns and paragraphs. You insert text and images in the individual paragraphs and you can define format/layout (such as font type and size, colors and margins) at global level (the whole template) or by column or paragraph.

SuperOffice Marketing is supplied with many ready-made message template layouts, and you can easily move columns and paragraphs around to get the appearance you want. You can also delete unwanted columns and paragraphs or add new ones.

> [!TIP]
> We normally recommend a maximum width of 600 pixels for mailings. You can also check what the mailing will look like, on smart phones for example, by clicking **Toggle view for mobile devices** ( ![icon][img5] ). See also [Customize the message for display on mobile devices][1].

## Menu overview

When you hover the mouse pointer over columns and paragraphs, menus are displayed in the form of toolbars at the top of the element in question. Which buttons are displayed depends on if you are pointing at a column or a paragraph. If you hover the mouse pointer over a button in the menu, a red frame is shown around the element in question, so that you always know which part of the template you are editing.
