# Create a target list

There are many ways you can create your target list. So, to make sure you know everything you need to know and remember when creating your target list, we have created a how-to guide.

You can make two types of selections to create your target list. In the how-to guide you will learn how to create a static and a dynamic selection.

## What to consider when creating a target list

Knowing exactly what you want to achieve with your mailing is key to the success of any marketing campaign. The goals you set will determine your target group, as well as the message you will send.

Your target list is the group of people you believe will respond best to your message, provided that they subscribed to receiving your marketing communication.

If you tailor your message specifically to that group, your chances of them doing what you want becomes significantly higher.

### Make sure you follow GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the digital privacy regulation that was introduced on **May 25, 2018**.

Not only is the GDPR a law, but it is also a great opportunity for you to create highly targeted marketing campaigns for people who are engaged with your brand. This way your chances of acquiring new customers grow exponentially!

## 4 ways to create your target lists

* **Selections:** This is a powerful tool that allows you to define your mailing's target list with precision. You can make your own selection from scratch or you can use one of our pre-set selections. To find the pre-set selections, go to the Selection section and type Company. You will find 4 selections ready to use. If you prefer to make your own selection, you can learn how to create a selection.

* **Projects:** You can send mailings to people connected to a project in SuperOffice CRM. Add the people you want to the project and choose this project as a recipient list for your mailing.

* **Single contacts:** You can add persons from the database one by one by searching for their names or another value. You can also paste in single email addresses to your target list. This is useful when you want to add someone just before sending.

* **Import a list of contacts:** You can import recipients from a file outside SuperOffice CRM.
  * If you want your results from the mailing to show up on a Contact card in SuperOffice CRM, you should use another option. You can consider importing the contacts into SuperOffice CRM first, and then create a selection. The latter option gives you the possibility of creating history of mailings on the Contact card.
  * Due to GDPR regulations, only contacts who have given valid consent can be added as recipients. When you import a list, SuperOffice will match entries with contacts in the CRM database. Any names or email addresses not found in SuperOffice will be excluded from the mailing.

## Narrow down your target list

By narrowing down your target list you avoid sending emails to contacts that are not interested. This way you can save costs and prevent yourself from wasting marketing resources. [Do not make the same mistake as 89 percent of all marketers][1], by sending your mailing to everybody in your database.

What to think of when you want to segment your database:

* Your database has to contain the right categories, such as Customer and Prospect or perhaps Customers A, B and C, to make the right selections.

* The contacts you want to send mailings to need to have a consent for e-marketing. This means that you have a legal basis for sending them mailings in the first place, and they have not opted-out from this (e.g. withdrawn their consent).

* In addition, you should consider using [tracked links][5] to learn what type of mailings your contact is happy to receive. For example, newsletters, invitations, product updates, or specific content topics. This allows you to send the right information to the right people.

* **Extra fields** are also important for your marketing routine. You can add extra fields to SuperOffice CRM that contain the information you need in order to create your perfect target list.

> [!NOTE]
> Ask your SuperOffice Administrator to edit/add lists and fields to further narrow down your target lists to fit any segmentation criteria and fields you need.

[How to create a selection][2]

### Static selection

A static Selection is a manually created list of records, either by selecting specific criteria or by adding individual records from the database.

The key feature of a static selection is its consistency - it **remains unchanged** until you manually modify it, unlike a dynamic selection which updates automatically with changes in your CRM database.

A static selection is particularly useful when you need full control over the contacts to whom you want to send your next marketing mailing.

### Dynamic selection

A dynamic Selection is akin to a saved search based on specific criteria. It can be updated at any time and will automatically incorporate list items, such as recipients, that meet your set criteria.

For instance, you could create a dynamic selection of all your customers. This selection will automatically update to reflect your current customer base, even as you gain new customers or lose existing ones.

Dynamic selections are particularly useful when you need **the most current data**.
