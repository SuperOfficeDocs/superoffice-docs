# Manage fonts for forms

Consistent typography enhances readability and trust. By managing the fonts available for your forms, you can ensure that all forms align with your brand guidelines and design standards.

## Where to manage fonts

Font management is done in **Settings and maintenance** and requires administrator rights. The fonts you configure here are available when styling forms in SuperOffice Marketing. They are not supported in mailings because not all Google Fonts are email-safe.

To access font management:

1. Go to **Settings and maintenance**.
1. Select <i class="ph ph-bullseye" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Marketing** from the navigator.
1. Select the **Form fonts** tab.

## Available fonts

* **Standard collection:** A set of default fonts is enabled out of the box. These are web-safe fonts that work reliably across all browsers and devices.

* **Google Fonts library:** You can add fonts from the Google Fonts library to expand your design options. These fonts are hosted by Google and loaded when the form is displayed.

## Add font from Google Fonts library

To expand your font options beyond the standard collection:

1. Click the **Add font** button.
1. Browse or search for a font by name.
1. Preview the font in regular, italic, and bold styles to ensure it meets your needs.
1. Click **Add font** to include it in your enabled fonts list.

## Remove a font

To remove a font from the available options:

1. Locate the font in the enabled fonts list.
1. Click the remove icon (<i class="ph ph-x-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>) next to the font name.

> [!NOTE]
> Forms that already use the removed font keep their font settings. The font is no longer available for new forms or when editing other forms.

## Organize fonts

You can reorder fonts to make the most relevant options easier to find:

1. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-six" aria-hidden="true"></i> next to a font name.
1. Drag the font to the desired position in the list.
1. Release to apply the new order.

Fonts appear in this order in the font dropdown when editing forms.

## Font preview

In the **Form font** tab, you can preview each enabled font. The preview shows:

* Regular
* Italic
* Bold
* Sample text: "Consistent typography enhances readability and trust."
