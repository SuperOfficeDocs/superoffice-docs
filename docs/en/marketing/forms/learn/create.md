If you are creating a form with many fields, it may be useful to split the form into multiple pages. This will make the form more user-friendly and easier to read. The user can navigate using **Next** and **Previous** buttons, and you can also add a progress bar to indicate how much is left to fill in.

1. Create a form as described above.
2. Go to the **Fields** category.
3. Click the **Add** button (![icon][img2]).
4. In the **Add element** window, select **View elements**.
5. Select **Section** and click **Add**. The window closes and a section is added to the form. You can also see the section In the form preview.
6. Click ![icon][img3] at the top of the section and drag it to the desired position in the form. The fields above and below the section will be on two separate pages in the form.
7. Click **Apply now** when you are done.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 to add another section.

## Filling in form fields

Click the headings to learn how to fill in the fields in the various categories:

### Properties

Fill in the following information in the **Properties** category:

* **Folder**: Select where to place the form or [create a new folder][8].

* **Description**: Explain the purpose of this form. This text is visible internally only.

* **Language**: Select the language used in the form.

* **Managed by**: Optional. Select a user group to limit access to this form. Only members of the selected user group can process submissions from this form and receive notifications of submissions.

* **Deactivate form automatically**: Optional. In some cases the form should be active only until a specific date or until a specific number of responses is received. Anyone trying to access an inactive form will be redirected to the page for inactive form. You can combine these options.

  * **Until**: Select a date. The form will be deactivated on this date.
  * **Max**: Enter the number of responses. The form will be deactivated after the specified number of responses are received.

* **Use Google Analytics**: Select this option to track the form and connect it to [Google Analytics][1] (if that is set up for your web site). In the field below this option, you can enter the Google Analytics tracking ID for this form.

### Add fields to the form

In the **Fields** category you add the fields that should be included in the form. As you add and edit fields, the preview on the right-hand side is automatically updated.

1. Go to the **Fields** category. By default, the **Contact - name** field and **OK** button are added to the new form.

2. Click the **Add** button ![icon][img2].

3. In the **Add element** window, select one of the following field categories:
    * **SuperOffice elements**: Fields that are linked to SuperOffice data, such as contact name, country, email address, and so on. Depending on the type of field, values from submitted forms can either replace existing values (such as country or title) or be added to the relevant SuperOffice field (such as mobile phone).
    * **Form elements**: Fields for entering text or date, fields for selecting values (lists, checkboxes and radio buttons) and file upload fields.
    * **View elements**: Sections, texts and images. Use sections to [create multi-page forms](#multi-page).

4. Select a field in the list.

5. Click **Add**. The window closes and the field is added to the form and the form preview.

6. Click ![icon][img3] at the top of the field and drag it to the desired position in the form.

    * In the **Placeholder** field, enter a short hint on what to enter in the field.
    * Select the **Mandatory** check box if this field must be filled in. The form cannot be submitted if mandatory fields are not filled in.
    * Click **Advanced options** ![icon][img5] to display the **Identifier** field, where you can add an ID for the field. This will be a unique ID for this field, and will not change even if the field name/label or the language changes. This way you can ensure that links to this field are not broken after publishing the form.
    * Click the check box **Full width** if you want the selected field to be the same width as the form.

The preview on the right is updated automatically when you change any settings. If you do not specify the height and width of the form, the form will automatically adapt to the screen size (desktop, tablet or mobile).

> [!TIP]
> You can add a progress bar to the form, so the user can see how much is left to fill in. Click the check box next to **Progress bar color**, and select a color. The progress bar is displayed at the bottom of the form. See also [Create multi-page forms](#multi-page).

This is done by sending them an email when they submit the form. The email contains a link they must click to confirm that the email address is correct.

    1. **Subject**: Enter the subject of the confirmation email.
    2. **Sender address**: Enter the email address to display in the **From** field in the confirmation mail.
    3. **Confirmation text**: Enter the body text of the email. Click **Show/hide toolbar** ![icon][img7] to display formatting options for the text. Click **Open text editor in dialog** ![icon][img8] to edit the text in a larger editor.

If double opt-in is activated for a form, all [submissions for this form][5] have status **Awaiting confirmation** until the email address is confirmed.

> Remember to add the **Contact - email** field in the **Fields** category.
