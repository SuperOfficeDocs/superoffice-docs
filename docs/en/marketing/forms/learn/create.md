3. Click the **Add** button ![icon][img2].

6. Click ![icon][img3] at the top of the section and drag it to the desired position in the form. The fields above and below the section will be on two separate pages in the form.
7. Click **Apply now** when you are done.
8. Repeat steps 2-7 to add another section.

### Add fields to the form

In the **Fields** category you add the fields that should be included in the form. As you add and edit fields, the preview is automatically updated.

1. Select **Fields** from the left menu. By default, the **Contact - name** field and **OK** button are added to the new form.

2. Click the **Add** button ![icon][img2].

3. In the **Add element** window, select one of the following field categories:

    * **SuperOffice elements**: Fields that are linked to SuperOffice data, such as contact name, country, email address, and so on. Depending on the type of field, values from submitted forms can either replace existing values (such as country or title) or be added to the relevant SuperOffice field (such as mobile phone).

    * **Form elements**: Fields for entering text or date, fields for selecting values (lists, checkboxes and radio buttons) and file upload fields.

    * **View elements**: Sections, texts and images. Use sections to [create multi-page forms](#multi-page).

4. Select a field in the list.

    * In the **Placeholder** field, enter a short hint on what to enter in the field.

    * Select the **Mandatory** check box if this field must be filled in. The form cannot be submitted if mandatory fields are not filled in.

    * Click **Advanced options** ![icon][img5] to display the **Identifier** field, where you can add an ID for the field. This will be a unique ID for this field, and will not change even if the field name/label or the language changes. This way you can ensure that links to this field are not broken after publishing the form.

    * Click the check box **Full width** if you want the selected field to be the same width as the form.

The preview on the right updates automatically when you change any settings. If you do not specify the height and width of the form, the form will automatically adapt to the screen size (desktop, tablet or mobile).

> [!TIP]
> You can add a progress bar to the form, so the user can see how much is left to fill in. Click the check box next to **Progress bar color**, and select a color. The progress bar is displayed at the bottom of the form. See also [Create multi-page forms](#multi-page).

Use the "Thank You" page to promote other products or events, linking to relevant parts of your website. This enhances the user experience and fosters customer loyalty.
