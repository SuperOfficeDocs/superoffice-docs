# Form submissions

When a form is submitted from a Customer Centre or website, the data is collected and displayed in the **Form submissions** tab. A red icon on the tab indicates new form submissions ![icon][img1].

In the **Form submissions** tab you can view all submitted forms. Use the filter options at the bottom of the list to view only submissions with specific statuses.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [view submissions for individual forms][1] by opening a form in the **Forms** tab.
