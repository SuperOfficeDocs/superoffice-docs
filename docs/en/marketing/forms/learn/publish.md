# Publish forms

After creating a form and (if relevant) the form response, you can publish the form.

## Steps

1. Go to the **Forms** tab.

2. Click the form to open it in view mode.

3. Set the form to **Active** ![icon][img1] in the header.

4. Go to the **Publish** tab.

5. (optional) Select **Show with pre-filled fields** to add field identifiers to the link/JavaScript. Useful for [pre-filling form fields][1] with existing customer data from SuperOffice.

6. On the left side of the screen, select a publishing option for the form:

    * **Direct link**: A direct link to the form.
    * **Embed inline**: A script tag used to add the form on a web page.
    * **Embed as popup**: A button to open the form in a pop-up window on the web page.
    * **Embed as side tab**: A side tab with a button to hide/show the form.

7. Copy the links/tags into a newsletter, website or customer centre to publish it to your customers or prospects.

## What happens now?

A notification on the **Form submissions** tab indicates that you have [received form submissions][2], which might need to be [processed manually][3].

Forms can be deactivated manually, or are automatically deactivated at a specific date or when a specific number of submissions are received.
