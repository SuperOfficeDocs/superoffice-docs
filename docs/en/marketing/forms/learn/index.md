# Work with forms

The forms feature is a powerful engine to get information from a form into SuperOffice without too much integrations and hassle. Forms make it easier to interact with customers and prospects via your website or customer centre. A wide variety of data can be added in a form (including file upload) and you can add automated actions to perform when the form is submitted and processed.

It is easy to create a form and post it on any web page you want it to show, like "Contact me" forms, and it is easy to transform all those new prospects to contacts in SuperOffice.

Examples of forms: start free trial, contact us, update data, consent management.
[How to create forms (examples)][1]

## What can I use Web forms for

You can use web forms to capture your website visitors' details â€“ their name, email address, preferences, comments, and feedback, and possibly convert them into customers. The data you get via web forms can be automatically imported to your SuperOffice CRM database, saving you time and effort.

* **Capture contact information:** The information people submit on web forms is saved in SuperOffice CRM, so you can follow up on them later.

* **Receive customer feedback:** Whenever customers or website visitors have a question, a problem or an inquiry, they can contact you directly on web forms.

* **Gain consent:** When a person gives you permission to store information about them on a web form, you know they are truly interested in your marketing messages. Not only will it increase the success of your email campaigns, but you will also follow the rules set by the GDPR.

* **Automate follow-ups:** Forms will help you speed up your work by automating manual tasks, such as creating follow-up activities, sending mailings, updating contacts' interests, and adding contacts to a selection or a project.

## Where can you find forms?

There are several ways to find forms. Go to either the Forms tab, form templates or the form submissions tab.

* **Forms:** is where you can create new forms and see all the forms that have previously been created. The Active forms tab, shows which forms are currently being used. The red bubble in the top-right corner on a form shows you the number of form submissions that haven't been processed yet.

* **Form templates:** is where you will find all available form templates. When you open this tab for the first time, you will find different templates in the Online template library. You can also import and use templates from the Online template library, or you can use them as an inspiration to create your own. Just click on the template you like and press Import template to download it.

* **Form submissions:** shows all details of the contacts who have submitted a form, and what their current form status is.

## Workflow

Creating a form follows roughly this workflow:

1. [Create a new form][2].
2. [Form response - Step 1: Setup][3] - an email can be automatically sent to a submitter when their form is processed.
3. [Publish forms][4] - use a link or JavaScript to publish the form in a newsletter or on a website or Customer Centre.
4. [Track form submissions and view statistics][5] - view the response rate in real-time.
5. [Process form submissions][6] - update SuperOffice with the submitted data, either manually or automatically. SuperOffice can identify existing contacts based on email addresses or create new contacts and companies.

## Use dashboards to get an overview of form submission

Having a dashboard for form submission makes it easy to measure and visualize their data. The dashboard allows you to keep track on performance, trends and productivity. Learn more about dashboards for form submission.
