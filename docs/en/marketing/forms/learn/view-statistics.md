# Track form submissions and view statistics

## Steps

To view statistics about your form, go to the **Forms** tab and click the form in the list. The **View form** screen opens.

## Tabs with form statistics

* **Summary:** Here you can find basic information about the form, including a preview of the form, and view various submission statistics:

  * **Total submissions:** How many forms have been submitted.
  * **Last submission:** When the last form was submitted.
  * **Completion last 7 days:** Submitted forms per day the last 7 days.
  * **Completion rate:** Status for submitted forms.
  * **Mailing:** This link provides access to the [form response mailing][2] used by this form. Click the link to view additional statistics.
