# Track form submissions and view statistics

## Steps

To view statistics about your form, go to the **Forms** tab and click the form in the list. The **View form** screen opens.

## Tabs with form statistics

* **Summary:** Here you can find basic information about the form, including a preview of the form, and view various submission statistics:

  * **Total submissions:** How many forms have been submitted.
  * **Last submission:** When the last form was submitted.
  * **Completion last 7 days:** Submitted forms per day the last 7 days.
  * **Completion rate:** Status for submitted forms.
  * **Mailing:** This link provides access to the [form response mailing][2] used by this form. Click the link to view additional statistics.

* **Form submissions:** Here you can view and [process all submitted forms][1]. A red icon on the tab indicates new form submissions.

To work more efficient, you can filter the records to show one or more form statuses or Mine/Primary groups. You find the **Filter** button (<i class="ph ph-funnel" aria-label="Funnel icon"></i>) in the lower-right corner.

## Use dashboards to get an overview of form submission

Having a [dashboard for form submissions][3] simplifies the process of measuring and visualizing data. With this dashboard, you can easily track performance, identify trends, and monitor productivity.
