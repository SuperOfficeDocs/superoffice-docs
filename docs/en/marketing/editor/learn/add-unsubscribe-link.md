# Add subscription links

When sending a newsletter, it is essential to provide recipients with the option to unsubscribe or modify their [subscription preferences][1]. This can be achieved by incorporating a clickable link.

Typically, the unsubscribe link is positioned at the bottom of the message. If you are utilizing one of our mailing templates, this link is pre-included.

You have the flexibility to determine the placement and wording of this unsubscribe link, as well as the action it triggers. For instance, clicking the link could direct the viewer to their "unsubscribe" page to manage preferences, or it could automatically opt them out of all your mailings.

## Steps

1. Go to the contents of the message and click the section where you want to insert the link.
    or
    Go to the **Blocks** section and click and drag a footer to the bottom of the message.

2. Type and select the text which the recipient has to click, for example "Click here to unsubscribe" or "Click here to manage your subscriptions".

3. Click the **Insert/edit link** button ![icon][img3] in the toolbar.

4. Click **Special links** and select one of the following options:
    * **Manage subscriptions**: Inserts a link to a web page where the recipients can select which mailing types they want to receive. The link is valid for 21 days by default.
    * **Unsubscribe from this type of mailing**: Inserts a link to unsubscribe to this mailing type. The recipient will still receive mailings of other types. The mailing type is selected in Step 1: Setup.

5. Click **Save**. The link is inserted in the message.

## What happens now?

Based on the feedback from the recipients, the subscription preferences are updated on the **Interests** tab on the contact card in SuperOffice CRM.

This means that the customer no longer receives this mailing type from SuperOffice Marketing, regardless of which recipient list is used for the mailing. This may be not what you want for future marketing. [What are my alternatives?][2].

You do, however, have the possibility to override "no consent / no subscription" settings, from **Options** in the lower part of the **Recipients** screen.
