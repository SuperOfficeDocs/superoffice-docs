# Add merge tags to your message

There is nothing better than a personal touch in business. To personalize your communication, you can use merge tags (also called template variables) to insert customer-specific information into your mailing.

Merge tags come in many forms: those might be the customer's first name, their company name, salutation, the name of the salesperson the customer was dealing with, and so on. In other words, merge tags are your easy-to-use tools to personalize the content for each individual customer.

1. Select a text in the message.

2. Type, for example "Dear ".

3. Position the mouse pointer after the text and click **Merge tags** in the toolbar.

4. In the list that appears, select **Contact** and **First name**.

5. Continue entering text and inserting the merge tags you require. For a list, see [the variable reference][2].
