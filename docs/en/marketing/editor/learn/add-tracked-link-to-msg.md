# Add tracked links to message

[!include[Requirement](includes/req-marketing.md)]

By setting up links that direct readers to various content on your website you can collect registrations, responses and monitor what products, offers and news your customers are interested in.

![Add a link to your mailing by selecting a part of the text that should be linked and clicking on the insert link icon in the text editor -screenshot][img2]

You can also **add special links** to your mailing. To do so, select Special Links dropdown. Depending on what you want to achieve, you can choose between:

* [Link to view message online][1]
* [Manage subscriptions][3]
* [Unsubscribe][4]
* Tracked links

## Steps

1. Go to the **Content** screen in the mailing, or open a template for editing.

2. Select the text or image that the recipient has to click.

3. Add the link.
    * To add an existing tracked link:

      * Text: Click ![icon][img1] in the toolbar, select **Special links** > **Tracked links**, and select a link.
      * Image: In the side-panel (under **Action**), select **Special links** > **Tracked links**, and select a link.

    * To [create a new tracked link][5], click **Create new tracked link** at the bottom of the screen. The **Link properties** dialog opens.

4. Click **Save**. The link is inserted in the message.

## Tips

You can add regular (untracked) links. For text links, click the ![icon][img1] link button in the toolbar. For image links, use the **Image URL** field in the side-panel. If you later decide you want to track these links also, you can select the **Track all links** option under **Tracking** in Step 1: Setup. However, these links are tracked only for the mailing in question, and will not be available for other mailings.
