# Add tracked links to message

By setting up links that direct readers to various content on your website you can collect registrations, responses and monitor what products, offers and news your customers are interested in.

![Add a link to your mailing by selecting a part of the text that should be linked and clicking on the insert link icon in the text editor -screenshot][img2]

## Steps

1. Go to the **Content** screen in the mailing, or open a template for editing.

2. Select the text or image that the recipient has to click.

3. Add the link.
    * To add an existing tracked link:

      * Text: Click the **Insert/edit link** ![icon][img1] in the toolbar, select **Special links** > **Tracked links**, and select a link.
      * Image: In the side-panel (under **Action**), select **Special links** > **Tracked links**, and select a link.

    * To [create a new tracked link][5], click **Create new tracked link** at the bottom of the screen. The **Link properties** dialog opens.

4. Click **Save**. The link is inserted in the message.

## Tips

You can add regular (untracked) links. For text links, click ![icon][img1] in the toolbar. For image links, use the **Image URL** field in the side-panel.

If you later decide you want to track these links also, select the **Track all links** option under **Tracking** in Step 1: Setup. However, these links are tracked only for the mailing in question, and will not be available for other mailings.
