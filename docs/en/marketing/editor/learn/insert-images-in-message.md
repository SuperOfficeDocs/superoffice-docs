# Insert images in the message

Create a stylish mailing using images. You can add images from the SuperOffice database, upload your own images, or use images from a royalty-free online image library.

After adding an image, you can add properties, such as a certain action, when the image is clicked on in the mailing

## How to set an image as background

1. Click a row in the message.
2. In the side-panel, scroll down to **Row properties** and **Background image**.
3. Click **Upload image**.
4. In the **Image library** window, follow one of the procedures below.

## Using an image from the SuperOffice database

1. Go to the **Content** screen in the mailing, or open a template for editing.

2. Select **Content** (![icon][img1]) in the side-panel.

## Resize your image

The image you want to use for your mailing might not always be the correct size. In our mailing editor you can also resize your images or add effects to make sure the image is optimal for your mailing and brand design.

After you upload the image, you can see how it looks inside your email template. If you are not happy with the size, you can adjust the image size, or resolution

1. Click the **Edit image** button.

1. You are now in the Effect dialogue. The toolbar gives you a wide range of options to change and adjust your image.
