# How to add your Google Analytics tag to a mailing

With Google Analytics enabled, you can track website visits from recipients who click on the links in your mailing. The Google Analytics tracking setting is set on a per-mailing basis, allowing you to selectively track specific mailings. It is not a blanket setting, giving you more control over your data tracking strategy.

## Requirements

To use the [Google Analytics feature][2], you need a Google Analytics account connected to your website.

## Steps

1. Open the mailing you want to track or [create a new mailing][1]. In the first step of the mailing wizard (Setup), check **Track all links** and **Use Google Analytics** under the **Tracking** heading.

2. **Google Analytics Tracking:** "Email" is pre-defined as the medium, so tracked mailings from SuperOffice CRM appear under Email in Google Channel reports.

3. **Source and Campaign:** Identify a specific mailing by completing the **Source** and **Campaign** fields.

    * The **Source** field can include different E-marketing subscriptions, like Monthly newsletter or Promotion mailing.
    * The **Campaign** field can contain campaign names, like Christmas sales campaign or Autumn sales campaign.

4. **Follow the mailing wizard:** After setting up tracking details, proceed with the mailing wizard. Choose your template, add content, add recipients, and send your mailing.

    * All links added in the Content step will be automatically tracked.

As soon as your recipients click on the links to your website, you can track their visits to your website in Google Analytics.
