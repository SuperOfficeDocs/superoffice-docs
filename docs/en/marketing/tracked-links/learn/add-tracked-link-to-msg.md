# Add tracked links to message

[!include[Requirement](../../../includes/req-marketing.md)]

## Drag and drop editor

1. Go to the contents of the message and edit a section. [How?][2]).

2. Select the text or image that the recipient has to click.

* To add an existing tracked link:

  * Text: Click ![icon][img4] in the toolbar, select **Special links** > **Tracked links**, and select a link.
  * Image: In the side-panel (under **Action**), select **Special links** > **Tracked links**, and select a link.

* To [create a new tracked link][5], click **Create new tracked link** at the bottom of the screen. The **Link properties** dialog opens.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add regular (untracked) links. For text links, click the link button ( ![icon][img4] ) in the toolbar. For image links, use the **Image URL** field in the side-panel. If you later decide you want to track these links also, you can select the **Track all links** option under **Tracking** in Step 1: Setup. However, these links are tracked only for the mailing in question, and will not be available for other mailings.

## Old editor

1. Go to the contents of the message and open the **Edit paragraph** screen. [How?][3]

2. Select the **Body** tab.

3. Enter or select the text which the recipient has to click, for example "Click here for more information".

4. Select this text and click the ![icon][img3] **Tracked link** button in the toolbar.

5. In the **Add link** dialog, do one of the following:

    * Click ![icon][img2] **Choose link** to select an existing tracked link.

    * Start typing in the search field (below the **Choose link** and **New link** buttons) to search for existing tracked links.

    * Click ![icon][img1] **New link** to create a new link. Links created using this option, are available only from this mailing (and copies of this mailing). To [create a tracked link][5] that can be used in other mailings as well, go to the **Tracked links** tab.

6. In the **Link label** field, you can edit the link text. Remember to add a space at the end of the text.

7. Click **OK** in the **Add link** dialog once you have finished adding links to the message. This takes you back to the **Edit paragraph** screen. The linked text is blue and underlined.

8. Click **OK**.
