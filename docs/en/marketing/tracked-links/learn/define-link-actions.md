# Define link actions

[!include[Requirement](includes/req-marketing.md)]

In SuperOffice Marketing you can add actions to your links. These actions are triggered when the recipient clicks a link.

Click here to go to the relevant topic:

| Tab | Action |
|---|---|
| Response | Add landing page or custom text. |
| Set field | Add a value to an extra field for customer contacts |
| Interests | Update interests. |
| Selection/Project] | Add/remove customer contact from a selection/project. |
| Follow-up] | Create a follow-up (task or appointment) in SuperOffice CRM. |
| Request | Create a new request. |
| Script | Execute a script. |

## Response

* **Redirect to new web page**: Select this option to redirect the recipients to a web page when they click the link. Enter the URL in the **URL to new page** field.

* **Show custom text**: Select this option if you want custom text to be displayed when the recipient clicks the link. Enter the text in the field below.

## Set field

In the **Set field** tab, you can specify that a value should be added to an extra field when the recipient clicks the link. This can be useful if you want to record extra information about customers who click the link.

Select a field in the **Set extra field** list box and enter a value in the **Value** field.

## <a id="interest" />Interests

Here you can specify that a link click should add or remove interests for the contact. For example, you could add the "Product news" interest if the recipient clicks the "Yes, please keep me informed about new products" link. Alternatively, you could remove the "Product news" interest if the user clicks the "Unsubscribe" link in a newsletter.

* In the **Set interest** list box, you can choose an interest to be added for the contacts if they click the link.
* In the **Remove interest** list box, you can choose an interest to be removed for the contacts if they click the link.
