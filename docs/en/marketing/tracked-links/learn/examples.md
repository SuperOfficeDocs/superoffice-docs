# Examples of the use of trackable links

[!include[Requirement](includes/req-marketing.md)]

Trackable links can be used in a variety of interesting ways:

> [!NOTE]
> The examples below work equally well for ordinary links, but in that case only the clicks for the individual mailing are recorded.

* **Response**: Each recipient who clicks a link, such as a new product page, is recorded in the system. This allows you to gauge the interest among all recipients across multiple mailings.

* **Prospect list**: If you are launching a new product, recipients can register their interest in the product by clicking the "Send me more info" link. Those who click the link can be added to a [static selection][3], which sales staff can use to manage further contact with these customers.

* **Follow-ups for salespersons in SuperOffice CRM**: One alternative to the prospect list in the example above is to generate a to-do or meeting for salespersons / customer contacts for each link click. A click on the "Contact me" link could, for example, generate a follow-up in SuperOffice CRM of type "Phone out" for the contact for that customer. In addition, the follow-up can be linked to a project in SuperOffice CRM, such as a marketing campaign.

* **Unsubscribe**: In the content editor, you can [insert a link for unsubscribing][1] from a specific mailing type. This means that the customer no longer receives this mailing type from SuperOffice Marketing, regardless of which recipient list is used for the mailing.

    An alternative to this unsubscribe link is to let the customer unsubscribe from individual recipient lists, such as the "Product A newsletter" list, so that they will still receive mailings from other recipient lists.

    You do this by adding a link (for example "Click here if you no longer wish to receive our newsletters"), which the customer can click to remove himself/herself from the recipient list. The customer is then removed from the selection you used as a basis for the mailing.

    If a newsletter is sent only to contacts with the "Newsletter" interest, you can define that this interest should be removed for recipients who click the link.

    > [!TIP]
    > To monitor who cancels their subscription, you can also ensure that those who click the link are also added to a separate selection named, for example, "Newsletter 2014 – cancelled subscriptions". It is possible to add multiple actions to the same link.

* **Individual follow-up**: You have just released a major update to your product. Not all your customers have an in-house IT department to deal with the update, so you add a link that the customer can click to book a consultant. A new request is then registered in SuperOffice Service for each customer who clicks the link. The request is allocated to the "Consultant" category, with the head of the consultancy department set as the owner. The customer is also sent feedback that they will be contacted by a consultant.
