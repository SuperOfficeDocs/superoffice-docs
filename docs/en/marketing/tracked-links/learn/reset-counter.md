# Reset counters for links

Sometimes, you need to reset the number of clicks back to zero. This would be the case, for example, after you have [sent out a test message][6], so that your own and others' clicking of links during testing are not included in your results.

1. Select the **Tracked links** tab.

2. Click **All links** if your link is not displayed in the list. If you use folders for links, first go to the folder the link is in.

3. Click the ![icon][img1] menu button next to the link and select **Reset**. The counter in the **Clicks** column changes to 0. Data about which customers have clicked the link are also removed.
