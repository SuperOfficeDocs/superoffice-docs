# Create tracked link

You can create trackable URLs in the **Tracked links** tab. These links will then be available when you and other users edit the contents of your mailings. This allows for efficient tracking of user interaction with the emails.

You can also create new links while editing the content.

## Steps

1. Select the **Tracked links** tab.

2. Optional: Select a folder or [create a new folder][2].

3. Click the ![icon][img1] **Add** button.

4. Enter a descriptive **Name** for the link.

5. Under **Link actions**, [choose what should happen][1] when the recipient clicks the link in the message.

6. Click **OK** when you are done.

A small dot on the link action tabs indicates which actions are active. Multiple link actions can be active for a link.
