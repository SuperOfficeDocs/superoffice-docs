# Work with tracked links after the mailing

You can include links (URLs) in an email mailing or form response and track them. In other words, you can see how many recipients have clicked them.

## Where can I find the links?

* To view the links for a single mailing, open the relevant mailing, click the **Tracked links** tab, and click the link you want to work with.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Tracked links** tab is not available for document mailings.

* To view the links for all mailings, click the **Tracked links** tab in the main SuperOffice Marketing screen. If you cannot find the link you want to work with, click **All links**. Click the link you want to work with.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only [registered links][2] are displayed here. If you add "regular" links in the mailing, you must select the **Track all links** option in Step 1: Setup.

## Explore clicks

1. In the active mailing, select the **Tracked links** tab.

2. Click the relevant link from the link list. The **View link** screen displays.

    Here you can see the number of clicks for the link and any [actions specified for the link][4]. In the **Clickers** list you can see who clicked the link and in which mailing they clicked the link.

3. Click **OK** to close the **View link** screen.
