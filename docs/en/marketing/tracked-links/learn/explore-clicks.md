# Work with tracked links after the mailing

Incorporating links (URLs) in your email mailings or form responses not only enhances interactivity but also allows for valuable insights. By tracking these links, you gain visibility into recipient engagement, quantified by the number of clicks. This data can be instrumental in refining your communication strategy and optimizing future interactions.

Let us delve into how you can work with these tracked links after the mailing is sent.

## Steps

1. Locate the links:

    * **Single mailing**: Open the mailing, select the **Tracked links** tab.

        This tab is unavailable for document mailings.

    * **All mailings**: From the main SuperOffice Marketing screen, select the **Tracked links** tab. If you cannot find your link, click **All links**.

        Only [registered links][2] appear here. To track all links in a mailing, enable the **Track all links** option in Step 1: Setup.

2. Choose your link from the list.

3. Explore clicks:

    Here you can see the number of clicks for the link and any [actions specified for the link][4]. In the **Clickers** list, you can see who clicked the link and in which mailing they clicked the link.

4. Next steps: Decide what you want to do next.

    * [Add clickers to selections or projects][3].
    * [Edit the link][2] by clicking the Edit button.
    * [Work with the recipient list][1].

5. Click **OK** to close the **View link** screen.

## How to check your mailing's results in Google Analytics

You can check the results of your mailings by logging in to your Google Analytics account. Your mailings should be visible in the Google Channel reports under Email.

> [!NOTE]
> Please allow Google Analytics some time to process your tracking information. Your mailing source may take somewhere between 1-24 hours to register in your reports.
