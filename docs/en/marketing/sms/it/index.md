# SMS connectors

You can use the Messaging agent with [CRMScript][3] to send SMS messages through a connector without configuring anything in SuperOffice.

However, if you want SuperOffice Service to send SMS messages during request handling or notifications, you must configure a connector.

## Available plugins

* CM
* Compaya
* Intelcom
* Link Mobility
* SMSTeknik
* Twilio
* TxtLocal

## Add an SMS inbox for incoming SMS

To [configure SMS settings][6], go to **Settings and maintenance** > **Requests** > **E-mail**, then click **New SMS mailbox** in the upper-right corner.

Even if the plugin only supports sending SMS, you must still configure this mailbox. This is where you define settings such as the category for incoming messages.
