# Resend your mailing

If, after looking at the results of your mailing, you notice that a lot of the email addresses have [bounced][1], this means these contacts did not receive your mailing. After you have handled the bounced emails, it is a good idea to resend your mailing.

There are two ways you can resend your mailing.

## Option 1 – Reload and resend

You can reload and resend your mailing in the **Mailings** tab. Find the mailing you wish to resend by searching for it or by going through the **Recent** or **All** tab.

In the bottom-right corner of the mailing you can click on the menu button. Here you can choose **Reload and resend**.

 you click **Reload and resend**, SuperOffice Marketing will update the recipients list that was used in the same mailing before. Overwriting all the email addresses that you have changed or added to the selection you have used as your recipients list.

The system will only send the mailing to those recipients who haven't received it yet.

After the mailing is sent, you can go into the mailing and see the new results in the **Summary** and **Recipients** tab.

## Option 2 – Resend to selected

Start by opening the mailing you wish to resend and go to the **Recipients** tab.

Here you can filter and select the recipients with the status **Bounced** and **Sent**, for example.

You can filter the recipients list by using the filter button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. And you can select the recipients you want to resend your mailing to by clicking the box in leftmost column of the recipients list.

After you have selected all the recipients, click on the **Actions** button and select **Resend to selected**.

SuperOffice Marketing will now send your mailing to all the selected recipients.
