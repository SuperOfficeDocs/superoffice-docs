# Resend your mailing

If, after looking at the results of your mailing, you notice that a lot of the email addresses have [bounced][1], this means these contacts did not receive your mailing. After you have handled the bounced emails, it is a good idea to resend your mailing.

There are two ways you can resend your mailing.

## Option 1 – Reload and resend

You can reload and resend your mailing in the **Mailings** tab. Find the mailing you wish to resend by searching for it or by going through the **Recent** or **All** tab.

In the bottom-right corner of the mailing you can click on the menu button. Here you can choose **Reload and resend**.

The system will only send the mailing to those recipients who haven't received it yet.

After the mailing is sent, you can go into the mailing and see the new results in the **Summary** and **Recipients** tab.

## Option 2 – Resend to selected

1. Start by opening the mailing you wish to resend and go to the **Recipients** tab.
