# Manage bounces

You can manage bounces and blocked emails for individual mailings as well as for ALL mailings.

## Why are emails returned?

Emails may be returned due to email address errors, spam filters, Internet problems or inboxes being full.

* Temporary problems: delivery delays, email server temporarily unavailable
* Permanent problems: wrong address, unknown domain.

Temporarily failing email addresses are not blocked, and they are not skipped in the next mailing.

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent misspelled or invalid email addresses, SuperOffice validates email addresses received through Chat and Forms. The validation is performed using DNS lookup and controlling basic email syntax.

## To fix a single email address

1. Select the email in the list and click **Open** in the side-panel to edit the contact.
2. Go to the **Details** tab.
3. A warning icon (![icon][img1]) next to the email address indicates a problem. Hold the mouse-pointer over the icon to view the cause of the problem.

> [!TIP]
> Click a column to access sorting and grouping functions.

## Blocked email addresses

Email addresses that have been returned due to permanent errors or have bounced several times are automatically blocked and will be skipped in future mailings.

> [!NOTE]
> If an email bounces more then 5 times, it is automatically blocked. You can adjust this setting in the global preference **Number of accepted bounces before email address is disabled** in SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance.

All blocked email addresses from all mailings are archived in the **Blocked email addresses** tab. This tab provides an excellent overview of email addresses that must be cleaned.

> [!TIP]
> Click a column to access sorting and grouping functions.
