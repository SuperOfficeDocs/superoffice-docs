# Follow up mailings

After your mailing is sent, it is always exciting to see how well your mailing has performed. To see if all your hard work has paid off. It is also a great opportunity to check and improve the quality of the information registered in your CRM database. The number of bounced emails, especially, is a key indicator.

Updating bounced email addresses will help you increase the success rate of future mailings. After you have updated the email addresses of all the recipients that bounced, you can reload your recipients list and resend your mailing to all updated contacts.

After the mailing was sent, SuperOffice Marketing collects data about the status of each sent email. In the **Recipients** tab, you can view the status for each recipient of the mailing.

You can also filter the list and export the results to selections and projects in SuperOffice CRM for further processing. The selection may, for example, contain recipients who have read the mailing, so that salespersons can follow up on them. To improve your customer data, you can create a selection of recipients who have not received the mailing (return/bounce), so that the person who looks after this customer can ensure that the correct contact information is registered in SuperOffice CRM.

If the status is still sent **Sent** (and not **Read by recipient**) after a few days, you should send out a reminder. If you are sending out an invitation to an event or a seminar for example, it is good to resend and remind those recipients who did not open and read your first mailing. You can create a new target list to resend your mailing.

After you have filtered out the recipients you wish to follow up on, you can [export all recipients to a selection or a project][2]. You can follow up on your recipients from this selection or Project.

## How can I follow up?

* [View the statistics][1] of the mailing and get information about any problems that occurred.
* [Add recipients to selections and projects][2] for further processing.
* [Check and correct the addresses of undelivered mails][2].
* See [who clicked the trackable links][4] you inserted in the message.
* Manage email addresses that were returned due to permanent errors or [bounced][3] several times.
