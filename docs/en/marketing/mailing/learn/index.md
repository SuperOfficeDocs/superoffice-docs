# Work with mailings

A mailing is usually handled in two steps:

* [Preparing and sending the mailing][1].
* [Following up the completed mailing][2].

## Mailing types

* Email
* SMS
* Document
* Form response

> [!NOTE]
> Email mailings and form responses are the most feature-rich of these mailing types. Features such as tracked links and subscription links are not available in SMS mailings and document mailings.

## Recipients

You can add recipients from multiple sources.

> [!NOTE]
> When you add recipients, only contacts with a valid email address (or mobile phone number, in the case of SMS mailings) are added to the **Recipients** list.

[!include[Note](../../learn/includes/note-imported-recipients.md)]

## Associating a mailing with selection or project

You can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project to keep track of all mailings related to your selections and projects.

The mailings are listed in the **Mailings** section tab in **Selections**, and in the **Activities** section tab in **Projects** in SuperOffice CRM.

> [!NOTE]
> If you add a selection or a project, any contacts in the selection or project are added as recipients in the mailing. If you add both a selection and a project, only contacts from the selection are added as recipients.

Example: If you send out multiple mailings to promote an event, you can add these mailings to a selection called "Event 2015" to have a complete list of all mailings for this event.

Similarly, if you create a project for your event, you can maintain a list of all project-related mailings in the **Activities** section tab.
