> SuperOffice will conduct a [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)][1] look-up to verify that the domain you are sending from has a valid SPF record. You will not be able to send the mailing from a domain that does not have a valid SPF record. (ONLINE ONLY)
>
> Do not enter an email address in the **From name** field. It should display as a name (for example, SuperOffice Support). Using an email address in the **From name** can lead to your email being flagged as spam due to conflicts with SPF, DKIM, or DMARC validation rules.
