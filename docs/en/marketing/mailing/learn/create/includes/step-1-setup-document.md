> To view and print an existing document mailing, close the **Setup** step (click **Cancel** or **Save + Close**). Select the **Mailings** tab, locate the document, click ![icon][img1] and select **View**. Click the button under **Download generated document**. The document is downloaded to your browser. Open and print the document.

Using the document mailing workflow you can generate a PDF document to print and send to your customers. The first step in creating a document mailing, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the name of the mailing, the heading and attention text in the document, and set archive options for the mailing.

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.

2. In the **Heading** field, enter the document title.

3. In the **Attention** field, you must select to whom the mailing should be directed. Select one of the following options:

    * **If none defined**: Select this option to use the recipients' names by default, or, if no recipient name is found, use the recipient you enter in the text field. If you are creating a mailing directed at IT professionals in a company, you can enter "IT department" or similar.

    * **Use always**: Select this option to override the recipients' names and only use the recipient you enter in the text field.

4. Optional: Start writing in the **Project** field to search for a SuperOffice CRM project.

    <details><summary>Why</summary>
    You can connect the document mailing to a specific project. This can be relevant if you are creating mailings where the recipients are project members from a SuperOffice CRM project. By using template variables in the template, you can add project data to your mailing.
    </details>

5. Optional: Start writing in the **Sale** field to search for a SuperOffice CRM sale.

    <details><summary>Why</summary>
    You can connect the document mailing to a specific sale. This can be relevant if you are creating mailings where the recipients are sale stakeholders from a SuperOffice CRM sale. By using template variables in the template, you can add sales data to your mailing.
    </details>

6. In the **Our ref** field, enter the name that should appear as our reference in the document. You can use SuperOffice CRM [template variables][1] in this field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For variables such as sale ID or project ID to work, you must link the document mailing to a sale or project.

7. Select a folder to place the mailing in from the **Folder** list.
