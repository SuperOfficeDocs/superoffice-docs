The first step in creating an email mailing, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the email header information such as sender, reply-to address and subject. You can also add attachments, set archive options for the mailing and select tracking options.

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.

2. Enter the subject of the email in the **Email subject** field.

3. The **From** section includes several fields:
   * Set a rule for the From addresses for your mailings. **Always use** means that your emails will be sent from the email address you specify. **Use our contact where specified, otherwise use** means that your mailings will be sent from your registered email address. If the Our contact address has an email domain that has not been validated, the mailing will automatically be sent from the address specified in the **Otherwise use** field.
   * Specify the email address you want to send from and select the domain. The available From domains will show in the dropdown list **Choose mail domain**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the global email validation preference has not been activated, you will be able to set any email address and domain as the From address. The system will notify you that the domain cannot be found during the SPF lookup. This means that your email address will likely end up in the receiverâ€™s SPAM folder.

4. In the **Reply to** list, you have the same options as above. In addition, you can select **Use "From" as reply address**. Any replies will then be sent to the sender.

5. Select a folder to place the mailing in from the **Folder** list.

6. In the **Selection** and **Project** fields, you can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project. If you add a selection, any contacts in the selection are added as recipients in the mailing.

7. In the **Type** list, select the type of mailing you are creating. Select **(Any)** if the mailing matches two or more of the available types. Use **(Any)** after adding multiple recipients with multiple subscriptions and you want to send the mailing to all.

8. **Attachments**: To add one or more attachments to the mailing, use one of the following methods:

    * Click **Upload files (or drag here)** to browse to and add a file from a disk or server.
    * Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer to the attachments field.
    * Click **Choose a CRM document** to select a document in SuperOffice CRM.
