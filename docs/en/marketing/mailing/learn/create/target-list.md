# Create a target list

There are many ways you can create your target list. So, to make sure you know everything you need to know and remember when creating your target list, we’ve created a how-to guide.

You can make two types of selections to create your target list. In the how-to guide you’ll learn how to create a static and a dynamic selection.

## What to consider when creating a target list

Knowing exactly what you want to achieve with your mailing is key to the success of any marketing campaign. The goals you set will determine your target group, as well as the message you will send.

Your target list is the group of people you believe will respond best to your message, provided that they subscribed to receiving your marketing communication.

If you tailor your message specifically to that group, your chances of them doing what you want becomes significantly higher.

### Define your goal

To ensure that your mailing is a success, you need, first and foremost, to reach out to the right people. The more you can narrow down your target group, the higher your chances are that the right message will reach the right person.

What do you want to achieve with your mailing? Do you want to:

* Get more leads?
* Sell more new products or services to your existing customers?
* Improve customer loyalty and retain customers?
* Inform of new developments, milestones or propositions?

SuperOffice CRM offers many ways of how to create a solid target list. You can use selections, projects or a single contact saved in the system. Any contacts that are not yet available in SuperOffice CRM database, can be added by importing an Excel list, provided that you have their consent to be sent marketing messages by your company.

You can also build a mailing list with the help of [online web forms][3]. Not only can you capture new leads among the visitors to your website who fill out a web form, but you can also use web forms to invite people to subscribe or sign up for different mailings.

### Make sure you follow GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the digital privacy regulation that was introduced on **May 25, 2018**.

Watch this video to learn what GDPR is:

> [!Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0aTpvBmVnY]

Not only is the GDPR a law, but it is also a great opportunity for you to create highly targeted marketing campaigns for people who are engaged with your brand. This way your chances of acquiring new customers grow exponentially!

**Checklist for marketing campaign:**

* Obtain explicit consent from your existing and potential contacts to receive marketing communication from your company. One way of asking for a permission is via mailings or web forms. Seeking permission and storing a record of it are the cornerstones of the GDPR.

* [Document any consents you obtain][5] regarding the lawful storage of personal data and sending e-marketing messages.

* Offer a simple and straight-forward way for your contacts to opt-out of your email marketing campaigns, by including clearly visible unsubscribe links in your mailings. Another way to make sure you contact only the people that want to hear from you is by creating a subscription management centre where data subjects can choose the content they want to receive.

* Obtain re-permissions from your existing customer base. This means that if you’re not sure whether or not you have the necessary permissions, and if you haven’t provided your contacts with the possibility to opt-out, it may be necessary to obtain re-permissions. Sending a “re-permission” campaign is also a great away to update your existing records.

## 4 ways to create your target lists

* **Selections:** This is a powerful tool that allows you to define your mailing’s target list with precision. You can make your own selection from scratch or you can use one of our pre-set selections. To find the pre-set selections, go to the Selection section and type Company. You will find 4 selections ready to use. If you prefer to make your own selection, you can learn how to create a selection.

* **Projects:** You can send mailings to people connected to a project in SuperOffice CRM. Add the people you want to the project and choose this project as a recipient list for your mailing.

* **Single contacts:** You can add persons from the database one by one by searching for their names or another value. You can also paste in single email addresses to your target list. This is useful when you want to add someone just before sending.

* **Import a list of contacts:** You can import recipients from a file outside SuperOffice CRM. Please note that if you want your results from the mailing to show up on a Contact card in SuperOffice CRM, you should use another option. You can consider importing the contacts into SuperOffice CRM first, and then create a selection. The latter option gives you the possibility of creating history of mailings on the Contact card.

## Narrow down your target list

By narrowing down your target list you’ll avoid sending emails to contacts that are not interested. This way you can save costs and prevent yourself from wasting marketing resources. [Don’t make the same mistake as 89% of all marketers][1], by sending your mailing to everybody in your database.

What to think of when you want to segment your database:

* Your database has to contain the right categories, such as Customer and Prospect or perhaps Customers A, B and C, to make the right selections.

* The contacts you want to send mailings to need to have a consent for e-marketing. This means that you have a legal basis for sending them mailings in the first place, and they have not opted-out from this (e.g. withdrawn their consent).

* In addition, you should consider using the Subscription management feature that lets you track what type of mailings your contact is happy to receive. Examples of subscriptions can be “newsletters”, “invitations”, “product updates”, or it can be specific content topics, and other. This allows you to send the right information to the right people.

* **Extra fields** are also important for your marketing routine. You can add extra fields to SuperOffice CRM that contain the information you need in order to create your perfect target list.

> [!NOTE]
> Ask your SuperOffice Administrator to edit/add lists and fields to further narrow down your target lists to fit any segmentation criteria and fields you need.

## Selections as target lists

Use selections to create your target lists to make sure you have the correct audience to receive your mailings.

[How to create a selection][2]

### Static selection

A static selection is a list of content that you create manually, by choosing certain criteria or by selecting single records from the database to add.

The distinctive feature of a static selection is that it stays the same until you decide to change it – manually add new records to an existing selection or delete single records, unlike a dynamic selection. A dynamic selection will automatically update when records are added to or removed from your CRM database.

You can use a static selection when you want absolute control of the content, for example, when you create a target list for a mailing. You’ll have full control over the contacts whom you want to send your next marketing mailing to.

Another way to use a static selection is to analyze performance in your organization – it’s easy to view the results from a specific area and period like last month, last quarter, and so on. By comparing the same static selection from different periods, you can see whether your company performed better or worse.

### Dynamic selection

A dynamic selection is like a saved search with a set of criteria. You can update it whenever you want, and it will automatically include list items, like your recipients, that match the criteria you have set.

For example, you can create a dynamic selection of all your customers. Even when you add new customers or lose some old ones, your dynamic selection will tell you exactly who your current customers are.

Use dynamic selections when you need to work with the most up-to-date data when creating a target list for a mailing, for example.
