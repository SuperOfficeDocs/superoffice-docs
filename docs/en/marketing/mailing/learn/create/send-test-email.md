# Send a test email for email mailings and form responses

After you have created a punchy subject line, added your text, inserted links and images into your email template, you can do a few tests to check that the mailing is working properly and that the layout looks OK. In the **Content** step you can send a test email. This is not relevant for document and SMS.

Create a small selection that consists of you and some of your colleagues. You can send the mailing you have prepared to yourself and colleagues to get feedback and approval before sending it to your target group.

## Steps

1. Go to the **Content** step.
2. Click the **Send test** button in the lower left corner.
3. Enter an email address. You can add multiple email addresses by using ; as separator.
4. Click **OK**. The email is sent to the specified addresses.

## What should I test?

When you are testing a mailing, it is important to check the following:

* That template variables are replaced with customer data. For example, you see "Hi John" and not "Hi **\[\[customer.firstname\]\]**".
* That links work and point to the correct pages.
* That clicks on links are registered in SuperOffice Marketing.
* That the opening of messages is registered in SuperOffice Marketing.
* That images are correctly displayed.
* That the layout of messages looks good.
* That the messages are up-to-date (dates/years, names, version numbers, and so on) and do not contain spelling mistakes/typos.
* That the mailing is [legible on a smart phone or tablet][1].

## Reset counters after testing

When you have sent a test mailing, you must reset the counters for the link(s) in the message. Otherwise, the list will display both your own and others' clicking of links done during testing.

1. Go to the links **Tracked links** tab
2. Click the menu button next to the relevant link and select **Reset**. The **Clicks** column is set to **0**. Data about which customers clicked the link are also removed.
