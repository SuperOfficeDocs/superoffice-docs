# Tutorial - SMS mailing

[!include[Tip](includes/tip-mailing-save-draft.md)]

## Step 1: Setup

The first step in creating an SMS mailing, is called **Setup**. Here you can set the name of the SMS mailing and the sender, and set archive options for the mailing.

1. Enter a name in the **Name of mailing** field.

1. In the **From** field, enter the sender name or mobile phone number. If you want the recipients to reply to the SMS, you must enter a phone number.

1. Select a folder to place the mailing in from the **Folder** list.

1. In the **Selection** and **Project** fields, you can associate the mailing with a selection and/or a project. Start typing to search.

1. Click **Next** to go to the next step.

## Step 2: Template

[!include[How to choose a template](includes/mailing-choose-template.md)]

## Step 3: Content

In the **Content** step you enter the content of the SMS.

1. In the **SMS text** field, enter the text. You can use [template variables for contacts][1] here. This works the same way as for email mailings. See [Use template variables in messages][2].

1. Click **Next** to go to the next step.

> [!NOTE]
> The number of characters (including spaces) is displayed in the **Number of chars** field. The character limit for 1 SMS message is 160 characters. If your message exceeds 160 characters, it is sent as 2 or more messages.
