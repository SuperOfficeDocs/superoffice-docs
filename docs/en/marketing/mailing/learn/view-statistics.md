# Analyze your mailing results

To decide whether a mailing was a success you need some numbers to compare it with. Learn how to analyze your mailing statistics in this how-to guide.

Did you know that the average open rate of a mailing across all industries is 21.33 percent?

This means that in general 1 out of 5 recipients will open and read your mailing. To see whether your mailing is above or below this average, you can analyze you mailing statistics per individual mailing.

## Analyze your statistics

SuperOffice gathers all statistics and results for each mailing you send. By comparing the results of different mailings you can see which subject line, type of content and links work best to engage and interest your recipients. These statistics will give you the information you need to improve your future mailings.

SuperOffice Marketing measures the effect of your mailing immediately. You can see the opening rate, the click-through rate for links, and which emails have bounced.

## Determine your benchmark for success

When is your mailing successful? This question can be hard to answer if you have not sent mailings to your contacts with a professional mailing solution. Therefore, it is a good idea to send out a few "test" mailings from your mailing solution to determine your benchmark.

To improve your future mailings, you have to find out what works for your contacts. The easiest way to do this, is to divide the target groups of your first few mailings into two or more groups. Then send them the same mailing, where you change the subject line, your call-to-action or other parts of the mailing.

The statistics from each mailing will show you which mailing performed better, and will give you your benchmark. Then, you can compare any future mailings' results with the benchmark you have set.

## Steps

To view statistics about your mailing, go to the **Mailings** tab and click the mailing in the list. The **View mailing** screen opens.

> [!TIP]
> Click the **Refresh** button to update the mailing statistics.

After your mailing is finished, you can see how your mailing performed in the **Summary** tab.
