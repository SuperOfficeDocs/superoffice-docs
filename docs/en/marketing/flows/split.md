# Flow control - split

## Steps

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot delete the "everyone else" branch

Success criteria can also be used as an early exit condition in the flow, eliminating the need for branching. Before any action is performed on a participant in a flow step, the participant's status is re-evaluated. This re-evaluation considers the success criteria. If a participant meets the success criteria, their status is updated to *Finished with success*, or they continue as *Active* if they are to complete the flow. At the finish step, participants who have met the success criteria are given the status *Finished with success*.
