# Flow contents

Flow contents is emails (and forms) used in a flow.

It does not matter if you prepare the content first, or after designing the flow. Also, whether separate users work with content and flow configuration - or if the same user prepares it all - is up to you.

1. Go to **Marketing** > **Flows**.
1. Double-click to select a flow.
1. Select the **Flow contents** tab.

## Edit prepared content

## Create new content

### Email

1. On the **Flow contents** tab, in the lower-left corner, enter a name for the new email and click **Create**.

### Form

Go to **Marketing** > **Forms**. For details, see [Create form][5].

## Add flow content to email step

1. Open the Flow editor.
1. Click to select the email step where you wish to add content.
1. Select which content to send.
1. Enter a subject. Use template variables for personalization.
1. Optionally, add one or more attachments (max 25MB total).
