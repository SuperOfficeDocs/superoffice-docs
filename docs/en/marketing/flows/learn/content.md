# Flow content

Flow content is emails (and forms) used in a flow.

It does not matter if you prepare the content first, or after designing the flow. Also, whether separate users work with content and flow configuration - or if the same user prepares it all - is up to you.

## Steps

To view the prepared content for a specific flow:

1. Go to **Marketing** > **Flows**.
1. Double-click to select a flow.
1. Select the **Flow contents** tab.

## Create new content

### Create email - as a flow editor

1. On the **Flow contents** tab, in the lower-left corner, enter a name for the new email and click **Create**. This opens the Mailing wizard at the **Template** step.

    * [Add content][3], [Edit a paragraph][4]
    * [Insert customer-specific information][5]
    * [Insert tracking link][6]
    * [Add subscription links][8] to be GDPR compliant
    * [Add images to the message][2]

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to act based on link clicks (for example, as a trigger, split, or wait condition), the link must be tracked.

1. Close the email step and click **Save**.

### Create email - as a flow administrator

1. Open the Flow editor and go to the email step.

1. Choose a template and compose the email as described above (starting on step 2).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot click **Edit** if the flow is running. If you do not wish to pause the flow while you prepare more content, you can create and prepare a new piece of content from the **Flow contents** tab.

### Create form

Go to **Marketing** > **Forms**. For details, see [Create form][1].

## Add flow content to email step

1. Click to select the email step where you wish to add content.
1. Choose **Select existing email for this step**. Click to select a prepared email.
1. Optionally, select **Task** > **Edit** in the email preview to update the content.
1. Close the email step and click **Save**.
