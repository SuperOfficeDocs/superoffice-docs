# Update flow

## Steps

## Move, duplicate, or remove step

* **Move:** Click a step and drag it to a new location.
* **Duplicate:** Point to a step and click the **Duplicate** icon ![icon][img11]. This create a new step based on the current one and adds it as the next step. Use this option to reuse a step in the same flow.
* **Remove:** Point to a step and click the red X. This removes the step from the flow (but not its content).

> [!NOTE]
> When you duplicate an email step, the Flow editor also creates a **copy of the email content**. You can edit this piece of new flow content independent of the email content in the step that was duplicated.
>
> When you remove an email steps, only the step is removed from the flow. The email content is not removed or deleted.
