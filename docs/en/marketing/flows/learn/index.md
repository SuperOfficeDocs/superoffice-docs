# Marketing automation - flows

Relevant emails not only increase the chances of being read but also impact the engagement with your call-to-action (CTA) links and foster stronger customer relationships.

## What is a flow

A flow is an automated sequence of marketing-related steps, such as sending a message, updating participant information, or creating an activity.

A **trigger** serves as the flow's starting point, defining WHEN a person is suggested as a participant in a flow. For example, when a person submits a [Contact Me form][9]. You can also [manually enroll SuperOffice contacts][4].

Additional **filters** are then applied to determine if that person belongs to the segment the flow targets. Filters determine WHO is added as participants. For instance, a lead-capturing flow that targets only prospects and not existing customers.

After enrollment, participants progress along the defined path. Upon completing a step, they move to the next. Participant status is reassessed before any action in a step. Learn more about [enrollment and flow logic][5].

## Workflow

Marketing automation follows roughly this workflow:

1. Plan your communication​.
1. [Create the content​.][7]
1. [Build the flow.][1]
1. [Define steps and actions.][6]
1. Set goals and track success.
1. [Monitor and analyze​.][3]

Flows support different ways of working​. Plan and create content before the flow is set up, then connect already prepared content to a specific flow. Or, begin by setting up the flow and leave room for the emails, which will come from content writers later.

## Where to find flows

SuperOffice Marketing has 1 tab pertaining to flows.

![Marketing Flows panel -screenshot][img1]

The **Flows tab** allows you to create new flows and view previously created ones. Use the secondary row of tabs (All, Recent, Running) and the search box to explore the available flows. Double-click a flow to view details about it.

Choose between list or tile **view mode** in the lower-right corner.

| Icon | Mode | Description |
|:-:|---|---|
| ![icon][img9] | Tile (thumbnail) | Shoes a thumbnail of each flow with essential data. Click the menu button ![icon][img3] to open, edit, or delete the flow. |
| ![icon][img8] | List (archive, grid) | Shows a list of all flows with information presented in columns. You cam group, filter, and customize the columns similar to columns in [section tabs][12]. Right-click to open the context menu to open, edit, or delete the flow. |

## <a id="view" />The View flow screen

At the top, you can see the flow's name and its location within the folder structure. You have the following options:

|Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Running | Toggle this slider button to start or pause the form. |
| Edit | Opens the flow in edit mode. |

The **View flow** screen consists of the following tabs:

* **Summary:** Provides basic information about the flow and various statistics.
* **Flow:** Offers a read-only view of the flow, allowing users to get an overview without pausing and editing the flow.
* **Reports:** Displays charts with statistics for the flow, used to monitor its performance.
* **Participants:** Presents a list of all participants within the flow, showing their email address, company affiliation, enrollment date, current status, current step, last sending received, date of the last sending, and status of the last sending.
* **Flow Content:** Includes flow mailings and forms used by the flow.

## <a id="success" >Success criteria

Success criteria establish the parameters for determining the success of a flow. For example:

* Contact updated
* Sale created on contact or company
* Follow-up created
* Request created
* Participant added to selection or project
* Form submitted
* Link clicked

By defining success criteria, you can gauge the efficacy of the flow: Are we achieving our objectives while the contact remains engaged in the flow? The **success rate** represents the percentage of enrolled participants in the flow who complete it with the success criteria fulfilled.

A success criterion may entail a change in a contact's category (such as transitioning to a sales-ready lead) while they are engaged in the flow. All interactions with the contact contribute to this change.

Any associate can fulfill success criteria by modifying data in the CRM database. The flow automation will respond appropriately, regardless of how the success criteria were met. Whether data is updated automatically by the flow or manually by a sales representative, the system functions consistently.

Upon meeting a success criterion, the campaign may either stop or proceed for the participant. In both cases, the participant is considered successful. You can determine if these successful participants should transition to a more relevant flow.

It is advisable for most automated flows to set success criteria for enrolled participants. However, it is not mandatory to define such criteria.
