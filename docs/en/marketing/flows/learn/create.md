### Settings (for flow)

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | |
| Description | |
| Timezone | |
| Owner | Associate creating the flow |
| Visible for | Owner, owner's group, all |
| Folder | |

### Email (settings)

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Subscription type | Set on flow level (instead of individually on each email step). Ensures all emails within a flow have the same subscription type. |
| From, from name, from address | Same sender on all email steps within the flow. In the **From** list, select **Always use** and enter the sender's email address in the field below to use the same sender for all mailings. You can also choose a sales contact or support contact as the sender, if one is defined for this recipient. Enter an email address to be used if no sales contact or support contact is available. If your admin has activated the [global email validation preference][12], select the domain you want to send from in the drop-down list. |
| Reply to | The same options as above. In addition, you can select **Use "From" as reply address**. Any replies will then be sent to the sender. |
| Only send emails and SMS within a specific timeframe | Select between Workday (Mon-Fri) and Weekday (Mon-Sun). Specify time. Requires that timezone is set.|
| Use Google Analytics | Enables Google Analytics tracking for all emails in a flow. When checked, you can set source and campaign. |

> [!TIP]
> Timing affects email open rate and interaction. Use the **timeframe** setting to maximize reader interaction and to not disturb your subscribers during night-time.

### Success criteria (optional)

Success criteria define what success means for a flow. For example:

* Contact updated
* Sale created on contact or company
* Follow-up created
* Request created
* Participant added to selection or project
* Form submitted
* Link clicked
* Had chat

**Steps:**

1. Click **Add success criteria** and choose an option.
1. Optionally select **Participant is moved directly to Finish step when the success criteria is met**.

    * If checked: The participant's status changes to *Finished with success** and they exit from any other actions later in the flow.
    * If not checked: The participant's status remains *Active* and they continue to follow the flow. When they reach the **Finish** step, their status changes to *Finished with success*. Use this option if success rate is used primarily for statistics, and you want the participant to complete all the steps even if success is reached.

![Set success criteria for new flow -screenshot][img3]

## <a id="trigger" />Define flow start trigger and filter

The **Trigger** step is automatically added as the starting point for any flow.

1. Click the **Trigger** step in the flowchart.
1. In the trigger settings on the right side, click **Add trigger** and choose an option.
1. Enter the required settings for the selected trigger.
1. Optionally, specify additional qualification criteria.
1. Optionally select **A contact person can only start this flow once**.
    The Flow engine keeps track of all former participants. If a flow is triggered a second time on the same contact, this setting ensures the contact is not re-enrolled.

![Add trigger for new flow -screenshot][img5]

> [!NOTE]
> It *is* possible to create a flow without any automated trigger. We will discuss this special case in another topic.

| Trigger | Description |
|---|---|
| Contact created | When a new contact is registered, independent of source (except import). |
| Contact update | When a contact is updated, independent of what is updated (except import and bulk update). |
| Order placed | When an order is placed on an existing sale registered on the contact. |
| Sale created | When a sale is registered on the contact. |
| Sale sold | When a sale on the contact is set to sold. |
| Sale lost | When a sale on the contact is set to lost. |
| Added to project | When contact is added as project member. |
| Request created | When a request is created on the contact (independent of source). |
| Form submitted | When a form (submitted by a contact) is processed. |
| Link clicked | When a contact clicks a tracked link. |
| Chat ended | When a chat with the contact ends. |

### Add contact filter (optional)

Use the contact filter to select specific contacts for your flow. For example, set the filter to *contact category = prospect* to trigger a flow only for prospects, not existing customers, who fill out a form on your website. This allows you to tailor content to different user groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Filters apply only when **identifying flow participants**. In an ongoing flow, contacts may be removed if they fulfill the success criteria.

1. Select the contact field you want to filter on.
1. [Select values for the criterion][13] in the various fields on the line (similar to in the Find screen).
1. Click **Add** to set additional criteria (adds a new line).

![Add contact filter on trigger of new flow -screenshot][img6]

### Exclusion list (optional)

Use a [static selection][14] to handle exceptions. The exclusion list **prevents selected contacts from being added to the flow**.

It supports scenarios such as sending reminders, excluding those already added, or preventing specific customers from receiving general mass emails.

## <a id="add-step"/>Add step

When you open the **Steps** tab for the first time, you will see something like this:

![Flow steps -screenshot][img4]

* A flowchart with a **Trigger**, a **placeholder** for adding a step, and a **Finish** step (in the center).
* A list of available step types (to the right).

1. Chose a step and drag it to where you wish to add it in the flowchart.
1. The step menu changes to **step settings**. Available settings depend on the step's type.

    Click the X in the step settings header to return to the step menu.

### Step types

* [Send message][3]
* Flow control
* Update participant
* Create activity

## Flow control

* Wait time
* Wait for action
* [Split][1]

### Wait time

Use a time-based waiting step to wait a specific amount of days before sending the next email/SMS, or to wait until a specific date for specific occasions or actions. For example, to send reminders 1 week, 1 day, and 1 hour before a webinar.

1. Drag the **Wait time** box from the step menu and drop it into an available slot in the flowchart.
1. Set the condition. Do one of the following:

    * Select **Number of days/hours after previous step** and then select number and unit.
    * Or, select **Until specific date/time** and then pick a date from the calendar.

Active flow participants stay at this step before continuing to the next step according to defined rule.

![Flow step wait time -screenshot][img7]

> [!NOTE]
> If the next step is an email or SMS, and a limited time frame is defined in email settings, the total waiting time might be longer than what's set in the step.

## Wait for action

Use an action-based waiting step to wait for the participant to do something (submit a form or click a link).

1. Drag the **Wait for action** box from the step menu and drop it into an available slot in the flowchart.
1. Click **Add action** and select which action to wait for.
1. From the list, select the name of the link or form to wait for.
1. Specify how long you are willing to wait for any action (a timeout). The default maximum waiting time is 7 days. If you uncheck this setting, participants who do not respond will be stalled at this step forever.
1. Optionally, select **Exit flow if no actions within max waiting time**. Participants who do not respond will leave the flow with status "drop out". You may choose to move them to another flow and/or add them to a static selection.

![Flow step wait for action -screenshot][img8]

> [!TIP]
> You can wait for more than one action within a single step. The first-occurring action (form submission, link click, or timeout) moves the participant further down the flow. Simply repeat steps 2 and 3 above.
