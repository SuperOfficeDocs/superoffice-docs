## <a id="logic"></a>Enrollment and progression through the flow

Before each step, SuperOffice CRM re-assess whether the participant can progress.

For all step types:

1. Is the participant's status *Active*?
1. Does the participant meet the defined success criterion?
1. Is the contact marked as a former employee?
1. Is the contact added to the exclusion list?

​Additional for email step:​

1. Is their consent valid?​
1. Is the contact subscribed to the flow subscription type?
1. Does contact have registered email address?​
1. Is the email address already active within the flow?​
1. Is the email address unblocked?​

Additional for SMS step:​

1. Does the contact have a registered mobile phone for SMS?

### How does success criteria affect enrollment

* Contacts that already meet the success criteria will still be added to the flow and counted as successes. Their progression through the flow steps depends on the configuration.

* Contacts that meet the success criteria after completing a flow will not be included in the flow's success rate, as it occurred after their active participation.

### Which branch will a participant follow?

In a split, participants follow the first (leftmost) branch where they meet the specified conditions.

## Tasks

* Add to selection: Includes the participant to a static selection.
* Add to flow: Indicates that this contact is proposed for enrollment in another flow.
* Remove from flow: Removes all record of the contact's participation in the current flow.
