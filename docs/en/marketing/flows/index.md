# Marketing automation - flows

What if you could send the right email to the right recipients at the right time? Relevant emails are more likely to be read by receivers, it affects if any CTAs are clicked or not, and can positively influence a customer relationship.

With marketing automation, you can tailor emails to a specific set of customers, where they are in their sales cycle, their level of engagement with specific products or services, their actions and so on.

* Qualify more leads

Or, begin by setting up the flow, leave room for the 3 emails which will come from content writers later.
