# Retrieving list of persons with ContactAgent

You can retrieve a `Person` list is with the `GetPersonList` method available through the `PersonAgent`. To use this service, we must know the IDs of the people we want before we can make the call. If we do not know the ID, we need to use a different service, for example, a method like `GetPersonsFromContact`.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/getcontactwithpersons-contactagent.cs)]

After we have created an instance of the `ContactEntity` calling the `ContactAgent`â€™s `GetContactWithPersons` method, we can iterate through the `Person` property of the instantiated entity and retrieve its properties.

**Output:**

```text
Full Name         ContactName             Email
Admin Adminson    StateZeroDatabase       example@example.com
Arne Arnesen      StateZeroDatabase       example@example.com
Brede Bredesen    StateZeroDatabase       example@example.com
Cato Carlsson     StateZeroDatabase       example@example.com
Donald Duck       StateZeroDatabase       example@example.com
Erik Eide         StateZeroDatabase       example@example.com
```

Another option is to use the [PersonAgent][1]
