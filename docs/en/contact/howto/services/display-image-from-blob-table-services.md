# How to display an image from the Blob table (services)

All pictures are stored in the `BinaryObject` table in the database. You can retrieve such information using `SoCore` and `SoDatabase` DLLs.

In this example, we display the image `Name`, which is contained in a `SelectableMDOListItem` object. We use the `IMDOAgent`â€™s `GetSelectableList` method to retrieve the information.

## Display image list

Following is the code for retrieving and displaying the image list in the ListBox.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/displayimagelist-services.cs)]

The `GetSelectableList` method requires 4 parameters:

* the image types that we want (project images)
* a Boolean value that determines whether to retrieve the list as a flat list
* any additional information we need to send
* a Boolean value that indicates whether to include only history values

## Display selected image

Once the list is displayed, the user will be able to select a name of which he wants to view the project image. The method below shows us how we can do this.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/display-image-services.cs)]

Above, we have used the `GetSelectableListWithRestriction` method and passed the image types, any additional information, and the ID of the item that was selected from the ListBox. This will retrieve a `SelectableMDOListItem`.

To get the image we need to use the `IBLOBAgent`. By using its `GetBlobStream` method, we can get the image into the `Stream`, which in turn can be used to display the image inside the PictureBox. The ID of the item contained in the `SelectableMDOListItem` should be passed to `GetBlobStream()`.
