# Update a person with a new name, address, position using OSQL

[!include[import OSQL namespaces](../../../api/includes/using-osql.md)]

## Code

The following example uses OSQL exclusively.

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/update-person-osql.cs)]

## Walk-through

If we have to update several tables, we need several update instances. Above, we have 2 update instances for the 2 tables. We have given the update values separately in the update instances we have created for the 2 tables. When we have more than one command to be executed against the database, we have to use the batch save instance since it can hold many SQL commands.
