## SuperOffice view of the world

SuperOffice has five important things:

* **Companies** are in code and database references called *contact*.
* **Associates** are SuperOffice users - employees of the company.
* **Projects** are a type of activity that usually involves several stakeholders and various types of other activities.
* **Activities** are things employees do with companies, contacts, projects, the diary, and sales.
  * appointments of various task types
  * documents
  * mailings and form submissions
  * chat sessions
* **Tickets** from Service are linked to persons who may or may not belong to a company.

You can [read more about the main tables][1] in the developer documentation.

### Business rules

* Activities happen at a particular point in time.
* Sales are expected to be closed on a date in the future.
* Appointments are scheduled for a particular date and time.
* Documents are written on a specific day.
* Activities start on one day and finish on another.
* Time is important for activities.
* Companies and projects are not time-specific but are linked to activities in time.

The appointment table contains foreign keys to all the other important tables, plus a date field (ActiveDate).

### Context-sensitive labels

It is important to keep in mind that there's not a 1:1 mapping of labels and that you have to take context into account.
