# Add relations (Contact screen)

A relation must always have two parties: one active and one passive. For example, Contact A owns Company B, while Company B is owned by Contact A.

**Relationship types** are defined in Settings and maintenance.

## Steps

[!include[Go to Contact screen](../../learn/includes/goto-contact.md)]

1. Select the **Relations** section tab.

1. Click **Add**.

1. In the **Relation** dialog, select **Active part** and **Passive part**. Use the dropdown or start typing to search for a company or contact.

1. Choose a relationship type from the **Relation** list, for example, "owns". The available options depend on whether the relationship is between a contact and a company or between two contacts.

1. Optionally, enter extra details in the **Description field**.

1. The **Result** field will auto-update based on the chosen relationship.

1. Click **Save**.
