# Delete contacts

Why would you delete contacts in SuperOffice? For example,a contact was added by mistake or is a duplicate, or a contact was added with only a first name.

There are three ways you can delete a contact from SuperOffice CRM:

* [Delete one contact][1]
* [Bulk delete contacts][3]

> [!TIP]
> Instead of deleting a contact, you can check **Former employee** in the contact card (see [Create new contact][6]). Then this person's name will not disappear from activities they are linked to.
