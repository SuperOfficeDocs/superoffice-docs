# Contact

A Contact card stores valuable information on all your communication and interaction with a person, as well as their GDPR consent documentation. Everything you want to find out about a contact is available from a single screen.

In the **Contact** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card, containing all information for that contact.

To move between contacts, click the previous/next buttons - ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] - at the bottom right of the cards.

You can [search][11] for specific contacts based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new contacts.

## Section tabs on Contact

The bottom of the **Contact** screen contains five default [section tabs][1]:

* Activities
* Sales
* Requests
* Projects
* Relations
