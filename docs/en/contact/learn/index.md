# Contact

The **Contact screen** provides an instant snapshot of all communication and interaction with a person. Here, you can manage contact details, track activities, and access GDPR-related documentationâ€”all from a single screen.

Contacts linked to a company can also be viewed in the **Contacts** section tab of the [Company screen][8]. Any activities added to a contact are automatically associated with the company.

You can navigate between contacts using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons (<i class="ph ph-caret-circle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="ph ph-caret-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>) at the lower-right of the screen.

Use the **Search** function to find specific contacts or filter records. From the Contact screen, you can also create documents, send emails, and generate follow-ups.
