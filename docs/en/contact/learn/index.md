# Contact

A Contact card stores valuable information on all your communication and interaction with a person, as well as their GDPR consent documentation. Everything you want to find out about a contact is available from a single screen.

[!include[Intro](includes/contacts-screen-intro.md)]

In the **Contact** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card, containing all information for that contact.

To move between contacts, click the previous/next buttons - ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] - at the bottom right of the cards.

You can [search][1] for specific contacts based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new contacts.

## Section tabs on Contact

The bottom of the **Contact** screen contains five default [section tabs][16] with information linked to the current contact:

| Section tab | Description |
|---|---|
| [Activities][11] | Contains all the activities linked to the contact. |
| [Sales][12] | Contains information about any sales connected to the contact. |
| [Requests][13] | Shows SuperOffice Service requests for the contact. |
| [Projects][14] | Shows all the projects where the active contact is a project member. |
| [Relations][15] | Displays any connections existing between the current contact and other contacts or companies. |

Everything you want to find out about a contact is available from a single screen.
