A blank email message opens, with the email address entered in the **To** field.

* In the country field, specify where the contact is located. It is important to enter the correct country, since this will affect the format of the contact's mail address and phone number. The default country is the country recorded for the company.

* Check the **Use as postal address** field if you want direct mailings to be sent to the address entered above instead of the company's postal address.

  * In the **Our Contact** field, your name is displayed automatically. Click the arrow to someone else from your organization.
  * In the **Category** field, select the category the contact belongs to, from a predefined list of categories. Click the arrow to show the category list.
  * In the **Business** field, select from a list of different predefined types of business. Click the arrow and choose the business that best matches the contact you are creating.
