  * In the **Our Contact** field, your name is displayed automatically. Click the arrow to someone else from your organization.
  * In the **Category** field, select the category the contact belongs to, from a predefined list of categories. Click the arrow to show the category list.
  * In the **Business** field, select from a list of different predefined types of business. Click the arrow and choose the business that best matches the contact you are creating.
