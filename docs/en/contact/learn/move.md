# Move a contact to another company

[!include[Requirement](../../learn/includes/note-req-manage-entities.md)]

Use this option when a contact changes departments or companies, or if they were assigned to the wrong company. Alternatively, disconnect a contact to remove their link to a company without moving them.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot move contacts (SuperOffice users) in your own company.

## Steps

1. Open the **Move contacts** dialog:

    * In the **Contact screen**: Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and select **Manage contacts** > **Move contact** from the menu.

    * In the **Company screen**: Go to the **Contacts** section, right-click a contact, and select **Manage contacts** > **Move contact**.

2. Under **Action on contact** choose one of the following:

    * **Move to**: Choose the company to move the contact to by typing or selecting from the list.
    * **Disconnect**: Remove the contact's link to the current company.

3. Under **Action on all existing activities and sales**, choose one:

    [!include[Select action](../../learn/includes/select-action-on-activity.md)]

4. Click **Move**. The contact is either moved to the selected company or disconnected, and activities are updated based on your choice.
