# Move a contact to another company

[!include[Requirement](../../learn/includes/note-req-manage-entities.md)]

You can move a contact - including their activities and memberships - from one company to another, for example, if a contact was set up under the wrong company, or if they changed department. Alternatively, disconnect the contact from the company.

**Steps:**

1. Do one of the following:

    * In the **Company** screen: Go to the **Contacts** section tab, right-click the contact you want to move, select **Manage contacts** and **Move contact**.
    * In the **Contact** screen: Go to the required contact, click the **Task** button ![icon][img2] in the contact card, and select **Manage contacts** and **Move contact**.

1. In the **Move contact** dialog under **Action on contact**, select one of the following options:
    * Select **Move to** and choose the company you want to move the contact to. Use [FastSearcher][1], [The History list][2] or [Find][3] ![icon][img3].
    * Select **Disconnect from &lt;company&gt;**.
