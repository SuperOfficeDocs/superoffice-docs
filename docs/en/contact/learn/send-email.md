# Send email to a contact

You can send emails to contacts from both the **Contact screen** and the **Company screen**. The process is the same after selecting the recipients.

## Send email from the Contact screen

1. [!include[Go to Contact screen](../../learn/includes/goto-contact.md)]

1. Do one of the following:
    * Click the email address in the **Contact** tab.
    * Click **New** on the top bar and select **Email**.
    * Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **Send email**.

   If the contact has multiple email addresses, select the one to use. Your default email program will open with the recipient's address filled in.

## Send email from the Company screen

1. [!include[Go to company](../../learn/includes/goto-company.md)]

1. In the **Contacts** section tab, select one or more contacts.

1. Right-click and select **Send email**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only contacts with email addresses are included in the **To** field. Contacts without email addresses are omitted.

## Finalize and send

1. Write the email.

2. Click one of the following options:

    * **Send:** Sends the email and logs it in the **Activities** section tab.
    * **Send and archive:** Sends the email and saves it as a document.

   If you choose **Send and archive**, the [Document dialog][1] will open. Add any required information and click **Create** to save.
