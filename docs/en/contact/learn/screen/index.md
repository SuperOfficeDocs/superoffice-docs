# The Contact screen

In the **Contact** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card, containing all information for that contact.

To move between contacts, click the previous/next buttons (![icon][img2] ![icon][img1]) at the bottom right of the cards

You can [search][8] for specific contacts based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new contacts.

## Section tabs in the Contact screen

The **Contact** screen contains the following section tabs with information linked to the current contact:
