# Relations tab

The **Relations** section tab displays any connections existing between the current contact and other contacts or companies. Example: information about ownership structure or about people who have been employed in different companies.

## Columns of the Relations section tab

* Names of contacts and companies that are part of a relation with the current contact.
* What relation they have to each other.
* Who created the relation.
* If a paperclip symbol (![icon][img1]) is displayed, this indicates that there is a more detailed description of the relation in the **Relation** dialog. Hold the mouse-pointer over the paper-clip icon (![icon][img1]) to display the description.

Double-click on a relation row to open the **Relation** dialog, showing all the [information entered for that relation][1].
