# Activities tab

The **Activities** section tab in the **Contact** screen contains all the activities linked to the active contact (including appointments where the contact is a participant).

If the contact is associated with a company, these activities will also be available in the **Activities** section tab in the **Company** screen.

## Reply to or forward emails

Email messages that are saved as documents for a specific contact are displayed on the **Activities** section tab for that contact. To reply to or forward an email, right-click the email and choose **Reply** or **Forward**.
