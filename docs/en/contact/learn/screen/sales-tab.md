# Sales tab

The **Sales** section tab shows sales connected to the contact.

[!include[Contents of the Sales section tab](../../../learn/includes/sales-tab.md)]

[!include[Conf. columns](../../../learn/includes/tip-configure-columns.md)]

Double-click a sale in the list to open the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about that sale.

Click **Add** to create a new [sale][1].

Click the **Filter** button ![icon][img1] to [filter the list][3] by date, users or groups.

If you check **Include stakeholders** at the bottom of the section tab, sales where the [contact is involved as a stakeholder][2] are also displayed.
