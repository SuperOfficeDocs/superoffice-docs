## <a id="warning" />Warnings and how to deal with them

In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, different rules can be defined for what is allowed and not allowed when you add products to a quote. Depending on how these rules are defined, various icons/warnings may be displayed when you add products to a quote. In some cases, the quote must be [approved before sending][1].

> [!NOTE]
> Products are added to and saved in a quote even if warnings and other messages are displayed, but you cannot send the quote while it contains errors and warnings. You must either correct the error or get the quote approved.

[!include[Table showing quote icons](includes/table-quote-icons.md)]

### Where are these warnings and messages displayed?

* In the **Add/Edit product** dialog
* In the **Edit quote** dialog
* On product lines in the **Quote** section tab and the **Products** (and alternatives) tab in a quote

### What causes these warnings and messages?

Warnings and messages may be due to, for example:

* Products not in the range
* Inactive price lists
* Product price is below minimum price or cost price
* Total price is zero or negative
* Total discount is too high
* Total earnings are too low
