# Work with quotes

After registering a sale in SuperOffice CRM, it is quick and easy to create a quote and send it to the customer. The quote can contain several alternative versions for the customer to choose between, and you have full control of the different versions of the quote if there are any changes.

Using the product database in SuperOffice CRM, you can easily add products to the quote – and let SuperOffice do the calculations for you.

When the customer has accepted the quote, you can generate an order which you send for further processing.

## The process of creating and sending a quote

1. Open a sale and [create the quote][1].
2. [Add products to the quote][2].
3. [Create the quote document][3]. This is the "letter" that accompanies the list of products that are being offered.
4. [Send the quote][4].
5. When the customer accepts the quote, you can [place the order][5].
