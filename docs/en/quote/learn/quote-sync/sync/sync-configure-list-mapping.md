# Configure list mapping

When synchronizing data between SuperOffice and ERP systems, you must specify which SuperOffice field and which ERP field belong together.

> [!NOTE]
> When editing an ERP connection, you must first deactivate it.

[!include[Go to sync](../includes/goto-sync.md)]

1. Select the ERP connection, and click the **List mapping** button at the bottom. The **List mapping** dialog displays the lists that are available for mapping. If no lists are displayed, you have not mapped any lists in [Configure field mapping][1].

1. Select a list on the left-hand side of the dialog. The available field items are displayed on the right-hand side of the dialog.

1. Select the corresponding CRM item for each ERP item.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Mapping is "one to one". You cannot map to the same CRM item twice. Double-mapped list items are displayed in RED. To leave an ERP list item unmapped, select **(No Selection)**.

1. Repeat steps 4 to 5 to map list items for the next list.

1. Check **Active** for the ERP connection you edited.
