# Add alternatives to a quote

You can add several alternatives to a quote, so that the customer can choose the most suitable one. Each alternative can contain different products, numbers of products, prices and discounts. You can also include only one alternative in the quote.

Alternatives are shown as tabs in the quote (in the **Edit quote** dialog).

## To create an alternative

1. Open an existing quote, or [create a new quote][1].

2. If you have not already done so, [add products][2] in the **Products** tab.

3. Click the **+** (plus sign) tab in the **Edit quote** dialog.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this tab is not displayed, alternatives are not enabled for the sales type of the current sale. You can select a different sales type, or enable alternatives for this sales type in Settings and maintenance.

4. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the alternative. This becomes the tab name.

5. Select one of the following:
    * **Create new alternative**: Creates a new alternative without products.
    * **Copy alternative**: You can copy and edit the existing quote (with associated products) as a new alternative. Select the alternative you want to copy from the list on the right.

6. Click **Add**. The new alternative is added as a new tab in the quote.

7. To change the name of the **Products** tab to something describing this alternative, double-click the name of the tab.

## <a id="fav"></a>Favorite alternative <i class="ph ph-star" aria-label="Star icon"></i>

If you create several alternatives in a quote, the first one (usually the **Products** tab) is marked with a star as the favorite (**Favorite alternative**). Estimated sales amounts for the sale (forecast) are obtained from the total amount for the favorite alternative.

If you want another alternative to be the favorite, select its tab, and click <i class="ph ph-star" aria-label="Star icon"></i> **Favorite alternative** at the bottom.

When [sending the quote][3], you can select to only include the favorite alternative.

## Delete alternatives

You can delete an alternative by clicking <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and selecting **Delete \[alternative\]** at the bottom of the tab.
