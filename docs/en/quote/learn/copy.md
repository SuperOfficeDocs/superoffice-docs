# Copy a quote

You can copy a quote from another sale. The sale you copy the quote from must have the same currency as the sale you are copying it to. The quote is copied with its products and alternatives.

1. Open any sale that does not contain a quote.
2. Select the **Quote** section tab, and click **Copy quote from another sale**.

    The **Create new quote by copying an existing quote** dialog appears.

3. Do one of the following:

    * Select the sale you want from the **Sales** list. If the list is empty, there are no sales with quotes and/or in the required currency.
    * Start typing the name of a sale to search.

4. Click **OK**. The quote is copied to the sale, and displayed in the **Quote** section tab with the status **Draft**.

5. [Edit the quote][1].

## Is the OK button disabled?

If the **OK** button is disabled, you have selected a sale that uses an ERP connection that you do not have access to. This means that the quote you are trying to copy gets products from a product list that you do not have permission to use.

Hold the mouse pointer over the disabled **OK** button to display the name of the connection that you do not have access to.
