# Add product to a price list

After you have added your price list to SuperOffice Quote, you want to populate it with your products, so your salespeople can use them when they create a new sales proposal.

After your products and the product information are added, your salespeople can use the same price details and follow the discount guidelines you have set up.

1. [!include[Go to products](../includes/goto-products.md)]

### How to change name and order, and make fields editable and/or mandatory

In the [Configure product dialog][3] you define the order and name of the field that are shown here and if they are editable or mandatory.

You can override the editable and mandatory settings by checking **Override default security** at the bottom of the **Add/Edit product** dialog. The changes will only apply for this one product.

### Are all these fields displayed in SuperOffice CRM?
