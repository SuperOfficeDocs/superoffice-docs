# Configure products

You can customize and configure the Quote Management features in Settings and maintenance to match the names and labels your users are familiar with.

The Configure product screen is located in the Settings tab. Here you can change and customize all labels used in Quote management. In addition, you can check whether a field should be editable and/or mandatory.

![You can change all labels of the fields in the product menu in the Configure product screen -screenshot][img3]

## Steps

You open the **Configure product** dialog by going to the **Quote/Sync** screen > **Settings** tab > **Configure product** button.

Here you can customize the content of the Product screen, which is where users add and edit products in the quote.

## Select language

In the list at the top you can choose the language you want to edit the product field for.

## Specify field properties

The view shows all product fields with their associated properties. At the bottom is information about the alternatives in the different columns.

### Show field

* Check each field you want to display in the Product dialog.
* Remove the checks for fields you do not want to display.
* Greyed out/non-editable checkboxes are fields that cannot be removed.

### Label

The default label for the (field name) field is shown here. You can edit this text. If you delete all the text in this field, the default label is restored.

### Tooltip

The default help text for the (field name) field is shown here. This text is displayed when you hold the mouse pointer over the field name in the **Product** dialog. You can edit this text. If the help text is long, you can use the arrow buttons to the right of the field to move up and down in the field.

### Editable/Mandatory

Check here if the users are to edit the field and/or to be obliged to fill out the field. The field is automatically set to **Editable** if you select **Mandatory**.

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, these alternatives are locked for functional reasons.

### Order

Click the ![icon][img1] ![icon][img2] arrows to choose the position of the field. This order is also used in the **Add/Edit product** dialog.
