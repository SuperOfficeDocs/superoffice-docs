# Rank fields shown in the ERP tab

You can set the order of the ERP fields displayed in the ERP tab in SuperOffice CRM. (You determine which fields should be shown in the ERP tab in the [Allocations dialog][1].)

1. [!include[Go to sync](../includes/goto-sync.md)]

1. Select the ERP connection, and click the **Rank Fields** button at the bottom. The **Rank fields shown in the ERP tab** dialog displays the tabs for the available actors in the ERP system.0

1. Select the tab for the actor you want to configure default values for. This tab shows all available fields for the actor (including both fields that are displayed in the **ERP** tab in SuperOffice CRM and those that are not).

1. Select a field in the list, and use <i class="ph ph-arrow-circle-up" aria-label="Arrow up"></i> <i class="ph ph-arrow-circle-down" aria-label="Arrow down"></i> to set the fields's order.

1. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to change the field ranking for other actors.

1. Click **Done**.

> [!TIP]
> Double-click a field to edit the default value for that field. See [Configure default values for synchronization][2].
