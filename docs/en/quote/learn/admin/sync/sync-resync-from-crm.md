# Resync from CRM

This function is used to fix problems, specifically if you know that the data in SuperOffice CRM is of better quality than the ERP data. It works like a normal sync, but timestamps are ignored and sync is in one direction only (CRM to ERP).

[!include[Back up database before import](../../../../admin/import/learn/includes/caution-backup-before-import.md)]

1. Go to the **Sync** tab in the Quote/Sync screen.
2. Click **Resync from CRM** at the bottom of the **ERP connections** list.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm.
