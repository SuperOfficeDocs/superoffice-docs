# ERP connections

The **ERP connections** tab in the **Quote/Sync** screen shows Quote Connectors and associated ERP connections. Quote Connectors are used for calculating quotes, sending orders to the ERP system and getting information from price lists.

## Available Quote Connectors

Active Quote Connectors are displayed here. Hold the mouse pointer over a row to display detailed information. Visible connectors are DLL files located on the server.

## ERP connections

Active ERP connections are displayed here. Double-click an ERP connection to edit it. The SuperOffice Standalone connector has different properties that can be adjusted. See [Add an ERP connection][1].

Select an ERP connection in the list, and click **Test ERP connection** to verify that the connection is working correctly.
