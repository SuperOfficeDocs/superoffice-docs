# Settings

In the **Settings** tab in the Quote/Sync screen, you can adjust the settings for quotes and configure the fields that are displayed for products.

## Quote settings

* **Use discount on Total Value**: Check here if you want the option of adding a total discount (percent or amount) for the whole of the selected quote/alternative in SuperOffice CRM. Two discount fields are then shown at the bottom of the **Products** tab in the **Edit quote** dialog.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The total discount is applied in addition to any discounts applied to the different products.

* **Default text for follow-up**: Here you can enter the text to be displayed for any follow-up that may be created for this quote. Users have the option of creating a follow-up when they send a quote.

* [Open Sale Types][1]: Click this link to go to the **Sale - Type, Stages, Quote** list. Every sale in SuperOffice CRM must have a sale type, and many of the default properties of a quote are obtained from the sale type of the associated sale. This applies to, for instance, the use of alternatives, the [quote template][3], validity of the quote and requirement for approval.

## Product dialog settings

Shows the fields used in each quote line in the quote. Click the field name links or the **Configure product** button to [edit these fields][2].
