# Approve quote before sending

In certain cases, a quote must be approved before you can send it. It may be that the earnings on the quote are too low, or the discount too high. A warning is displayed in the quote, and the quote is assigned the status **Needs Approval**. The rules regarding approval are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

1. You must ask a person who has the authority to approve quotes to perform the approval.
2. They must open the quote and click **Approve** (or not).
3. The quote then has the status **Approved** (or **Not approved**).
