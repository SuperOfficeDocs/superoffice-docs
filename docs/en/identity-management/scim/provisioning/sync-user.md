# Sync user to SuperOffice now

You can manually synchronize 1 selected user. This is useful when you update SCIM rules affecting a few already synchronized users and you don't want to trigger a full bulk-update.

## Pre-requisites

* You are [signed in to the SuperOffice Identity Manager][1]

## Procedure

1. Open the **Configurations** tab.

2. Select the user you want to sync in the **SCIM users** pane:

      Browse the groups or use the search box.

3. Look at the info displayed in the **Preview** pane:

    * If you are good to go, click **Sync user**. Otherwise, update the SCIM rules, preview again, and sync when OK.
