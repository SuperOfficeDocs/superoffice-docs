# Preview what will be synced

Use the **Preview** tab to review the result of the current SCIM rule set.

Previewing synchronization is useful when you are defining your rules to explore the effect of a rule. It also gives you a clear view of how the provisioned users will appear in SuperOffice CRM Online.

## Pre-requisites

* You are [signed in to the SuperOffice Identity Manager][1]

## Preview all users

Open the **Preview** tab.

* At the top, you can see the total number of users received from Azure AD and how many of those will be synced to SuperOffice.

* The table shows the result of applying the mapping currently set in the **User sync rules** pane.

You can filter, sort, and reorder the information shown in the table.

## Sort and reorder preview

* To sort the table, click on the column heading you want to sort it by. Clicking the same column multiple times will toggle between ascending and descending sort order.

## Filter users in preview

If you have a lot of users, possibly extending multiple pages, or you want to drill down into 1 specific mapping, you can apply 1 or more filters.

A filter consists of a string and an operator and is located directly below the column header.
