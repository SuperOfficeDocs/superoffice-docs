# SCIM rules

A SCIM rule describes users in their SuperOffice CRM Online tenant.

The [SuperOffice Identity Manager][1] givesÂ administrators access to a wizard where they can configure rules for how users shall be configured in our system.

* The Azure portal sets the mapping from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly AAD) to the SCIM schema.

* The SuperOffice Identity Manager sets the mapping from the SCIM schema to [SuperID user accounts][2].
