# Guide to federated sign-in

This guide will take you briefly through the identity management steps to let your users sign in to SuperOffice CRM Online with Microsoft or Google.

## Pre-requisites

* A SuperOffice CRM Online tenant (site) with existing users

* Compatible domain - [check my domain][1]

* SuperOffice administrator account

* Google or Microsoft account

* For Azure AD, you need to be Global Admin

## Guide

1. [Map usernames in SuperOffice Admin to UPNs][2] managed by the identity provider.

2. [Register your domain name][3] (IdP).

3. Ask each user to [sign in to complete account transformation][4].

## Standard sign-in with an identity provider

The next time the user signs in from `online.superoffice.com` and provide the correct user name or UPN, the user is forwarded to [SuperID][5] to establish which service to use.

Does the user's browser session **have an active session** from the identity provider?

* If **yes**, they will be silently signed in to CRM Online

* If **no**, they will be redirected to the provider to sign in
