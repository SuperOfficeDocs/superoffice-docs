# Identity providers and document handling

SuperID support Microsoft or Google as document repositories. We offer self-service set up identity providers (IdP) and document handling.
Advanced IDP setup: additional configuration that can be set up by R&D services. For example, sub-domains and custom domains.
Other identity providers are available on request if they support OpenID Connect.

## Microsoft SharePoint

* [Microsoft 365 SharePoint documents integration][2] is self-service.
