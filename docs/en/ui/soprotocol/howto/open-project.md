# Open project

The soprotocol should be on the format: ```soprotocol:project.main?project_id={{id}}```

## Open project with ID = 1000

```soprotocol:project.main?project_id=1000```

## Open project and display more

```soprotocol:project.udef?project_id=1```

Here, *project* is the target panel, and *udef* is the target upper tab view.

## Open project and display links and project members

```soprotocol:project.links.projectmembersarchive?project_id=1```

This link opens the Project page displaying the Links tab above and the project members grid tab below:

```http://localhost/SuperOfficeWeb/default.aspx?project.links.projectmembersarchive```
