# Open company

The soprotocol should be on the format: `soprotocol:contact.main?contact_id={{id}}`

## Open company with ID = 2

On the Company page, showing the main tab above and the contacts grid below, with the company details on the right, where the `contact_id` equals 2, use the following SoProtocol URL:

`soprotocol:contact.main.personarchive.minicontact?contact_id=2`
