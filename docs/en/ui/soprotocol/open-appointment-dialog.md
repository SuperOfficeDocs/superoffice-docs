# How to open the Appointment dialog

The following example shows how to open an Appointment dialog in the current context based on a given appointment\_id, "appointment\_id = 124". If the current context is displaying the company page, the appointment dialog will appear over the company page.

`www.example.com/Default.aspx?appointment?appointment_id=124`

To view the appointment in the context of the diary, use SoProtocol to navigate to the diary page and then use the appointment_id to view the day where the appointment appears.

`www.example.com/Default.aspx?diary.main?appointment_id=124`

Use the \[dialog=stop\] parameter to open the appointment dialog in the whole window.

`www.example.com/Default.aspx?appointment[dialog=stop]?appointment_id=10`
