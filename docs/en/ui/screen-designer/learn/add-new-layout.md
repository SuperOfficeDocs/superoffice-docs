# Add new screen layout

With custom screen layouts for each of your teams, finding customer data will be easier than ever. The most relevant data will always be available and visible. Remove, move or hide irrelevant or less important data to unclutter the company, contact, sale and project screens. Add customized archives with the most relevant data for your teams. The result will be a cleaner and more tidy screen for your teams to work in.

**Steps:**

[!include[Go to screen designer](includes/goto-screen-designer.md)]

1. Select **Main cards** or **Archives** (also known as section tabs).

1. If relevant, click the text next to **Assign layouts to**.

    By default, the layouts can be assigned to user groups.
    If, however, you are adding main card layouts for the **Sale** or **Project** screens, you can assign the layouts to sale types or project types.

1. Click **Add** under **Layouts**.

1. In the the **Add new layout** dialog, select a layout in the **Create new based on** list.

    The new layout will be based on the selected layout.

1. Enter a name for the new layout in the **Name** field.

1. Click the **Assign to** field and select the user group(s) that will use this new layout.

    The list will display only user groups that are using the default layout. A user group can only be assigned to one layout. Sale types or project types will be available here, if you selected these options in step 3.

1. Enter a description of the layout in the **Description** field.

1. Click **OK** when you are done. The new layout is added to the **Layouts** list. It has the status **Draft**, meaning it is not yet visible to any users. The preview is displayed on the right side of the screen.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you later want to edit the layout settings, double-click the layout in the list to open the **Edit layout settings** dialog. You cannot edit the settings for the default layout.

1. With the new layout selected in the **Layouts** list, click the **Edit layout** button to customize the screen layout. See [Edit layout - Main cards][1] or [Edit layout - Archives (section tabs)][2].

> [!NOTE]
> To delete a layout, select the layout in the **Layouts** list and click **Delete**. User groups that were assigned to the deleted layout, will go back to the default layout.
