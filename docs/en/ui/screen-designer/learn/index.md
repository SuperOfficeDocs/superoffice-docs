# Screen designer

 ![icon][img1]

The Screen designer feature allows you to configure your main screens in SuperOffice CRM. You can create different screen layouts for different user groups, depending on their information needs and workflows. This will help your organisation to be more effective and focus on what matters most.

> [!NOTE]
> Screen designer (configurable screens) requires the Developer Tools licence.

The Contact and Company cards/screens in SuperOffice CRM come with a default layout, but you can edit them or create your own layouts. Since different user groups often use the Contact and Company cards differently, it could be a good idea to create different layouts for each user group.

Screen designer allows you to remove the unnecessary fields and/or create new, more relevant fields. You can also group the fields in tabs or columns and add your own headings (called "labels"). If you find some of the tabs unnecessary, you can easily remove them or replace them with the tabs that are more suitable for your organization.

Your sales team, support team and management team do not necessarily have the same focus and requirements concerning the data they need to access most frequently in SuperOffice. The solution is to create custom screens for each team. Your organization will save time by allowing your teams to find relevant information more quickly. Configure the layout of your main screens and archives (section tabs), and define which types of information each team (user group) can access and see on the company, contact, sale and project screens.

* Move the most important fields to the first tab.
* Use columns, labels/titles and dividers to organize information into logical groups.
* Format fields to emphasize key data (for example, bold and large font) for better visibility.
* Move less important fields to secondary tabs.
* Remove fields that are never used.
* Add links/buttons for looking up information in other websites or to manually trigger an automated process based on CRM Script.

> [!NOTE]
> When this feature is activated, the fields in your current **More** tab for the **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale** and **Project** screens will change to form two columns. You can edit these tabs in the screen designer (see [Edit layout][1]).

You can create custom screen layouts for the company, contact, sale and project cards, as seen at the top of the screen. The **Layouts** list displays any existing screen layouts (usually the default layout), with a preview screen on the right.

The layouts are marked with status (published or draft) and the assigned user groups.
