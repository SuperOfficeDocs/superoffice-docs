# Tutorial - Front-load country

## Step 1: Purpose

In SuperOffice, addresses are formatted based on country and region. To encourage users to select country first, we are going to move that field to the top of the **Company** screen.

When you are done, it should look something like this:

![Company card -screenshot][img1]

[!include[Requirement](../../../includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

## Step 2: Open the Screen Designer

1. Go to **Settings and maintenance**.
1. Select **Screen Designer** from the navigator.

## Step 3: Open the layout in edit mode

1. Select **Company** at the top.
1. Select the **Main cards** tab directly below.
1. Select the default layout from the list.
1. Click **Edit layout** at the bottom of the screen.

## Step 4: Update the fields

1. Select the **Company** tab in the preview.
1. Click to select the **Country** field.
1. Grab the **=** to the left of the field label, drag it to the top of the list, and drop it into the new position.

## Step 5: Save, publish, and test results

1. Click **Save + Publish**.
1. In another browser tab, sign out of SuperOffice. Then sign back in.
1. Go to the **Company** screen to see the result.

You might want to do this for the **Contact** screen too.
