# Assign layout to group or type

[!include[Requirement](../../../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

## Steps

1. Open the Screen Designer.

1. At the top, select a screen or dialog to customize.

1. Select assignment method (if not set): click the text next to **Assign layouts to**, and choose group or type.

    * Company and contact: user group only
    * Sale: user group or sale type
    * Project: user group or project type
    * Request: user group or request type
    * Follow-up: user group or follow-up type

1. Select a layout in the list on the left side.

Click the **Assign to** field and select a group or type. Your options depend on the selected screen.

## Restrictions

* The default layout cannot be assigned.
* A user group can only be assigned to one layout per screen.
* If you delete a layout, user groups assigned to it, will go back to the default layout.
