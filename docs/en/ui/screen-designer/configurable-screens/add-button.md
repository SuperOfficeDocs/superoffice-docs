# Add a button or link

[!include[Requirement](../../../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

Custom buttons and links are added to the **Preview** pane when editing a layout. The URL is used to open a webpage in the current or new tab, run a CRMScript from the screen, or navigate to other parts of SuperOffice using [SoProtocol][3].

Buttons and links work similarly. The difference is that you can style a button but not a link.

> [!TIP]
> You can use [template variables][1] in the URLs.

The instructions below assume you're already [editing the layout][4].

## Add a button

1. Select the tab you want to edit.
1. Select the **Elements** section on the left.
1. Click and drag the **Button** element to the layout.
1. Click to select the new button.
1. In the **Settings** sections to the left, replace the text "Button" with the new button name.

    > You can also add the link name in other languages.

1. In the **Action** list, select the action to perform when clicking the button. For details about each action, see the reference section at the end of this page.

    * Open website: Select this option to add a link to a website. Select the URL encoding and target as necessary.
    * Execute CRMScript: Select this option to add a [CRMScript][2] to run specific actions in SuperOffice.

    * Shortcut ([SoProtocol][3]): Select this option to add a control that, when clicked, navigates to a different area or screen in SuperOffice.

1. In the **Mode** list, choose if the button should always be available, or if it should only be available in read or edit mode.
1. In the **Style** list, select the style of the button.

1. Select the **Elements** section on the left.
1. Click and drag the **Link** element to the layout.
1. Click to select the new link field.
1. In the **Settings** sections to the left, replace the text "Link" with the new link name.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also add the link name in other languages.

1. In the **Action list**, select the action to perform when clicking the link. (Same list as for buttons.)
1. In the **Mode** list, choose if the link should always be available, or if it should only be available in read or edit mode.

When the element is selected:

1. Click the **A-Z** button next to the label.
