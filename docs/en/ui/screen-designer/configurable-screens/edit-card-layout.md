# Edit the layout of a card

[!include[Requirement](../../../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

## Considerations

Before customizing a layout, determine who the intended users are.

* What do they need at their fingertips?
* Do they need all default fields and tabs, or should you remove something?
* Do they require additional tabs?
* What is the logical order of fields?

> [!NOTE]
> You can edit the **default layout**, however, you can't edit the default control settings and you can't re-assign the layout to a user group.

## Edit card layout

1. Open the Screen Designer.
2. Select a card at the top: Company, Contact, Sale, or Project.
3. Select a layout in the list on the left side.
4. Click **Edit layout** below the preview.
5. In the **Edit card layout** window, work your way through the tabs of the screen.

    * [Add, edit, move, or remove a field][1]
    * [Add link or button][2]
    * [Organize information into logical groups][4]
    * [Add, remove, or restore a tab][3]

## Save, publish, or cancel

After editing a layout, click one of the following buttons:

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| Save draft | Saves an unpublished version of the layout, which you can resume editing later or ask someone to review. |
| Save + Publish | Applies the layout to the selected user groups. |
| Cancel | Discards all changes. |
