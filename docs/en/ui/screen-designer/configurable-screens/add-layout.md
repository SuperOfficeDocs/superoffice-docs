# Add a layout

[!include[Requirement](../../../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

Whether you add a personalized view for a selected user group or design a layout optimized for specific project types and sales types, start by adding a new layout for a screen in the Screen Designer.

## Create new layout

To create a new screen layout:

1. Open the Screen Designer.

2. At the top, select a screen: Company, Contact, Sale, or Project.

3. Under **Layouts**, click **Add**.

4. In the **Add new layout** dialog, select a layout from the **Create new based on** list.

5. Enter a name and description for the new layout.

6. Click the **Used by** field and assign the new layout to one or more user groups **or** sale/project type.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only groups currently using the default layout are shown.

7. Click **OK**.

    The new layout is added to the **Layouts** list with status Draft, meaning it is not yet visible to any users. The preview is displayed on the right side of the screen.

## Customize the new screen layout

1. With the new layout selected in the **Layouts** list, click the **Edit layout** button.

2. Work your way through the tabs in the layout.

    * [Add, edit, move, or remove a field][1]
    * [Add link or button][2]
    * [Add, remove, restore a tab][3]

3. When you're done, save or publish the layout.

## Delete a layout

When a user-group-based layout is deleted, users in that group see the default (system) layout.

To delete a layout:

1. Select the layout in the **Layouts** list.
1. Click **Delete**.
