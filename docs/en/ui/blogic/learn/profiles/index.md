# Profile

[!include[Restricted access](../../../../learn/includes/note-insufficient-rights.md)]

Profiles in the system are used for configuring the appearance and behavior of screen elements.

[!include[Legacy](../includes/legacy-profiles.md)]

For example:

* Move or add columns in the list of requests in the Contact screen
* Add or remove fields in the Request screen header (also **Contact** and Company screen headers)
* Customize the search results screen to your needs

Each screen element can have personal, common and global profiles.

* Personal profiles apply to a single user.
* Common profiles are linked to a role and apply to all users who have that role.
* A global profile is used as the default profile and applies to all those who do not have a personal profile or who have not been assigned a common profile on the basis of the role they belong to.

Using profiles, SuperOffice Service can be adapted to the needs of individual users, groups of users or the whole organization.
