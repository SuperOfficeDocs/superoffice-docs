# Global profiles

A global profile is used as the default profile and applies to all those who do not have a personal profile or who have not been assigned a common profile on the basis of the role they belong to.

## Create

To create a global profile, follow the instructions to [create a common profile][1], but you also check **Set as default profile** at the top of the **Edit element profile**.
