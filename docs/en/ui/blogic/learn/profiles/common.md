# Common profiles

Common profiles are linked to a [role][2] and apply to all users who have that role. You configure common profiles in the **Show profiles** screen.

## Profile types

* **System**: These profiles you can configure by following the procedure below.
* **System screens**: A list of screens created using the [system designers][1] in SuperOffice Service. You can change these if you have access to **System design** > **Screens**.
