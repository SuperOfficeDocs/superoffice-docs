# Personal profiles

[!include[Legacy](../includes/legacy-profiles.md)]

Personal profiles apply to a single user. You configure personal profiles in, for example, the list of requests in the Contact screen, the request properties section in the Request screen or the search results screen. We will use a concrete example to explain how this works. In the example below, we assume that you want to add a field in the Request screen.

1. Open the Request screen and select the **Details** tab.

2. Click <i class="ph ph-wrench" aria-label="Wrench"></i> beside the request's properties. The **Edit element profile** screen appears.

3. Next to **New field** are two empty fields.
    * In the leftmost box, enter the field name.
    * Click <i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Chevron"></i> and select which field in the database you want to get data from.

4. Click **Add** next to the two fields you have just completed. This new field is added under the preview at the top of the screen.

5. Click **OK**. The changes are saved, and the next time you display this screen the new field is included.

6. To revert to the default settings, return to the **Edit element profile** screen and click the **Restore default (deletes this profile)** button at the bottom of the screen.
