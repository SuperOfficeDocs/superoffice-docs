# Personal profiles

Personal profiles apply to a single user. You configure personal profiles by clicking ![icon][img1] (the "spanner" icon) available in different screens, for example, the list of requests in the **Contact** screen, the request properties section in the **Request** screen or the search results screen. We will use a concrete example to explain how this works. In the example below, we assume that you want to add a field in the **Request** screen.

1. Open the **Request** screen and select the **Details** tab.

2. Click ![icon][img1] on the far right of the request's properties. The **Edit element profile** screen appears.

3. Next to **New field** are two empty fields.
    * In the left-hand field enter the field name.
    * Click the list button ![icon][img2] next to the field on the right, and select which field in the database you want to get data from.

4. Click **Add** next to the two fields you have just completed. This new field is added under the preview at the top of the screen.

5. Click **OK**. The changes are saved, and the next time you display this screen the new field is included.

6. To revert to the default settings, return to the **Edit element profile** screen and click the **Restore default (deletes this profile)** button at the bottom of the screen.
