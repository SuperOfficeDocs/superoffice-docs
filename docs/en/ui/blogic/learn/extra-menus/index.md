# Extra menus

[!include[Legacy](../includes/legacy-extra-menus.md)]

In the **Extra menus** screen, you can add extra menus (buttons, menus, links, shortcuts, lists, and so on) in SuperOffice, so that the functions and information you need are always easily available.

## Where can I add extra menus?

* **Top menu**

* The **Status** tile on the dashboard
  * ![icon][img1] **Task** buttons in the main screens
  * Menu buttons in the extra table view

* **Navigator**

  * Additional options on the navigator buttons
  * Additional options under **System design**
  * Additional options on the **New** button in the top bar.

## What can I add as extra menus?

* URLs: Links to web pages or to specific records in SuperOffice.
* Screens: Shortcuts to specific screens.
* Scripts/macros: Buttons or menu options that trigger a script or macro.
* Selections: Shortcut to a selection.
