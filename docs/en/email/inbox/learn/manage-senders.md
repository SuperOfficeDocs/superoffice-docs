# Manage senders

SuperOffice Inbox helps you identify and manage email senders. If the email address is not yet registered in SuperOffice CRM, you are prompted to add it as a contact. You can also look up a sender's details or register additional addresses directly from the email header.

## Look up known contact

You can view contact information for senders and recipients in the message header.

* **Hover** to show a preview with name, title, company, and phone numbers.
* **Click** to open the full contact card.

If multiple contacts match the email address, a list appears so you can select the correct one.

## Add unknown sender to SuperOffice

When the sender is not recognized, a yellow bar appears above the message preview.

1. Click the **Unknown sender** link in the banner to open the **Add contact to SuperOffice** dialog.

1. In the dialog, you can:

    * Search for an existing contact or company.
    * Select a company match under **This contact might work at** if suggestions are shown.
    * Click **Create new company and contact** to register both , if the sender is not yet in SuperOffice CRM.

> [!TIP]
> You can also click any unrecognized email address in the header, including *Cc* or *To*. The same dialog opens. If the domain is recognized, matching companies are listed. If not, you can still search or create a new entry.
