## Look up sender in SuperOffice

You can easily look up information about a sender in SuperOffice CRM.

1. In the inbox, select an email.
2. Click the sender's name and email address in the email header.
3. What happens next, depends on whether the sender's email address is found in SuperOffice:
    * If the email address is found on a company/contact, the company/contact card is displayed.
    * If the email address is registered on more than one company/contact, a dialog will appear, listing the alternatives and allowing you to choose.
    * If the email address is not registered in SuperOffice CRM, you can click **Create new company and contact**.

## Add sender's email address to a new or existing contact in SuperOffice

5. In the **Add contact to SuperOffice** dialog, select one of the following options:
    * Search: Search for a company or contact you want to add the sender's email address to.

    * **Create new company and contact**: Click this button if the sender is a new contact from a company not previously registered in SuperOffice.
    * **Do not add contact to SuperOffice**: If you are archiving an email message or creating a task, you can click this button if you do not want to register the sender's email address.
