# Accept invitations

You can receive calendar invitations from person outside your organization and add the follow-ups to your SuperOffice diary. Invitations must include an iCal file (`.ics`). Emails with invitations are marked with these icons:
<i class="ph ph-paperclip" aria-label="Paperclip"></i>
<i class="ph ph-calendar-blank" aria-label="Calendar"></i>

If the meeting organizer is a unique registered contact in SuperOffice CRM, the invitation is automatically added as a tentative follow-up in your diary. Whether this also happens for other users depends on email preferences set in **Settings and maintenance**.

## Steps

1. In the inbox, select the email that contains the invitation.

1. Before accepting, review any additional attachments.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > When you accept or decline the invitation, the email is removed from the inbox and moved to the **Deleted** folder. If you want to keep any attachments, [archive or download them first][1].

1. Click **Accept** and choose one of the following options:

    * **Accept and notify sender**
    * **Accept, but do not notify sender**

The follow-up is added to your diary, and the message is removed from the inbox.
