# SuperOffice Inbox <i class="ph ph-at" aria-hidden="true"></i>

SuperOffice Inbox is a built-in email client that lets you manage your email directly inside SuperOffice CRM. You can handle messages, attachments, and calendar invitations, and link emails to contacts, sales, projects, or requests all in one place.

## Open the inbox

Select **Inbox** <i class="ph ph-at" aria-hidden="true"></i> in the navigator to open the SuperOffice Inbox.

## Inbox layout

The inbox screen is split into two panes:

* **Left pane:** Shows a list of messages in the currently selected folder.
  * Click **New e-mail** to [create a new message][3].
  * Click the folder name (for example, **INBOX**) to select another folder from your connected email account.
  * A label such as **5 new** next to the folder name indicates the number of unread messages in that folder.

* **Right pane:** Shows the selected message and available actions, such as reply, archive, and more.

## Inbox icons and function

| Symbol | Description |
|---|---|
| <i class="ph ph-magnifying-glass" aria-label="Search icon"></i> | Search the current folder. |
| <i class="ph ph-sort-ascending" aria-label="Sort ascending icon"></i> / <i class="ph ph-sort-descending" aria-hidden="true"></i> | Sort messages by date, sender, or subject, in ascending or descending order. |
| <i class="ph ph-funnel" aria-label="Filter icon"></i> | Show or hide messages based on criteria such as sender type, unread status, or date received. |
| <i class="ph ph-cloud-slash" aria-label="Not subscribed icon"></i> / <i class="ph ph-cloud-check" aria-label="Subscribed icon"></i> | Indicates whether the selected folder is subscribed and synchronized. Click to toggle subscription. Some folders (such as Inbox and Sent) cannot be unsubscribed. |
| <i class="ph ph-arrow-clockwise" aria-label="Refresh icon"></i> | Refresh the message list. |

> [!NOTE]
> Even if a folder is subscribed and refreshed, only the most recent emails are shown. By default, SuperOffice downloads emails from the past 30 days (Online) or 180 days (Onsite). Contact support to change this limit if needed.
