# SuperOffice Inbox

The inbox in SuperOffice CRM is based on a separate email client, which gives you access to your email via the Internet, without requiring you to have an email program installed locally on your PC. In this main topic we explain how to use this email facility.

## How do I get to the inbox in SuperOffice CRM?

Click the **Inbox** button in the Navigator.

> [!TIP]
> If you click the word **Inbox** instead of the actual button, a list is displayed. From the list, you can choose which email folder to go to.

## Sections

The **Inbox** screen consists of the following main sections:

* On the left side of the screen is the inbox. You can easily switch between, for example, the inbox and sent emails.
* On the right, you can view the selected message and perform various actions.

## What would you like to do now?

* [View email messages][1]
* [Compose an email][2]
