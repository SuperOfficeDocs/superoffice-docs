# Compose an email

> [!TIP]
> The procedure below describes how to compose an email message from the inbox. You can also compose an email message by clicking **New** > **Email** on the top bar.

## Create email from the SuperOffice Inbox

[!include[How to compose an email](../../learn/includes/howto-compose-email.md)]

## Entering information in the New email dialog

If you create a new email based on a template, the **New email** dialog will in some cases display because a setting in the template allows you to add additional information to the email. This is especially relevant when using templates with template variables for sales and projects, where you must select the relevant sale or project for the variables to be filled in when you send the email.

Fill in the fields below, click **Create** and compose the email as described above.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Document template | Click <i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Chevron"></i> next to the type field at the top of the dialog to display a list of document templates that you can choose from. The available templates are defined in Settings and maintenance. |
| Company | Enter here the name of the company you are writing to. |
| Contact | Click the arrow next to this field and a list of known contacts in the company is displayed. |
| Project | Enter the name of the project that the email should be linked to. |
| Sale | Enter the name of the sale that the email should be linked to. |
| Visible for | Click the **Visible for** field to display a list that allows you to choose if the email should be visible to all users, only yourself, or visible to all users in one of the user groups that the owner belongs to. |
| Language | If the selected template includes translated versions, you can select a language for the template. |

## Send

When you finished the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:

* To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.
* To send the message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens. [How to create a document][1].

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still [go to the sent folder and archive the message][2].
>
> The signature template at the bottom of the message can be edited in <i class="ph ph-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Personal settings** > **Edit personal signature**.
