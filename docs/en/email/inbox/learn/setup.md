# Set up SuperOffice Inbox

The SuperOffice Inbox is an alternative way to connect your email to your SuperOffice CRM for email clients that cannot be connected via WebTools.

## Before you begin

* Make sure IMAP is enabled in your email client. SuperOffice Inbox supports most of the IMAP email servers.

* To be able to send out emails from SuperOffice CRM, make sure that the email address you are going to use with SuperOffice Inbox is same as the first email registered in your Contact card/screen.

## Why is the email list is not updated?

Some email providers, such as Gmail, will block login attempts from unknown apps. Check your inbox to see if your email provider has sent you information about an unauthorized login attempt. Follow the instructions in the email to allow SuperOffice to access your account.
