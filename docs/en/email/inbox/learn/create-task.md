# Create task

You can quickly create a follow-up task (todo) based on an email message in the SuperOffice inbox. The new task is automatically linked to the sender, and you can also connect it to a project, sale, or other context.

## Steps

1. Select a message in the inbox.

1. Click the **Archive** button (<i class="ph ph-archive" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and choose **Create task**.

1. If the sender is unknown, the **Add contact to SuperOffice** dialog opens.

    * Start typing to search for an existing company or contact.
    * Or, click **Create new company and contact** to register them.
    * To skip adding the sender, click **Do not add**.

1. The [Follow-up dialog][3] opens with fields prefilled based on the email. Update the information as needed.

    * **Company** and **Contact** are automatically suggested.
    * Link the task to a **Sale** or **Project** if applicable.
    * Choose a **Type**, set the **Date** and **Time**, and enter a **Description**.
