# Create activity from an email

If you receive an email requesting you to take action, you can convert the email into an activity in SuperOffice CRM.

1. Select the email(s) you would like to archive as an activity.

2. Click the **Archive email** button on the toolbar, and select **Create activity** from the dropdown. The **Create activity** dialog appears.

3. If the sender of the email is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the **Create activity** dialog: **This sender's email address is not recognized. Click here to update SuperOffice with this email address**. [How to handle unlisted senders][1]

4. In the **Company** field, you may search for a company by starting to type the company name and then select from the matches that appear.

5. In the **Contact** field, you may use the dropdown to select one of the contacts belonging to the company you selected in the previous step. You can also search by starting to type the contact name.

6. If you would like to link the activity to a certain project, you may select the project in the **Project** field.

7. If you would like to link the activity to a certain sale, you may select the sale in the **Sale** field.

8. In the **Description** field,the subject and message body is automatically inserted. However, you may enter any text that you would like to be shown in **Task** dialog of SuperOffice CRM.

9. In the **Do by** field, today's date is automatically inserted. However, you may click the calendar icon and select another date the activity should be completed by.

10. In the **Time** field, edit the time of day the activity should be completed by.

11. In the **Type** dropdown, you may select one of the available activity types.

12. In the **Visible for** field, click the arrow next to the field. A list is displayed allowing you to choose if the activity should be visible to all users, private (visible only to the user defined as owner) or visible to all users in the user group that the owner belongs to.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Visible for** field is only available if this right is assigned to you in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

13. Check the **Completed** box if you would like to indicate that the activity has already been completed.

14. Outlook only: Check the **Remove from inbox** box if you would like to remove the email from the inbox and move it to the **Deleted items** folder in the mail client after it was archived successfully in SuperOffice CRM.

15. Click **OK**. The selected email(s) are archived to SuperOffice CRM as activities. You can then open any of these activities by double-clicking them in the **Activities** section tab or in the checklist in the **Diary** screen.
