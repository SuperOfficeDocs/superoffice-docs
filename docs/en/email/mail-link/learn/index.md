* Archive an email as a request in SuperOffice Service.
* Search for the sender of an email.
* Set functions for default archiving.
* Use SuperOffice templates or predefined email body templates when creating emails.
* Update the information about companies and contacts in SuperOffice CRM based on emails you receive.
