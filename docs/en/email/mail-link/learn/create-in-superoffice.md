# Creating emails from SuperOffice CRM

There are two ways of creating an email from SuperOffice CRM. You can use the **Email** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. This works more or less the same way as described in [Creating emails from Microsoft Outlook][1] or [Creating emails from Lotus Notes][2], except that you can use predefined email body templates.

You can, however, also use the **Write** toolbar button.

1. Click the **Write** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window.
2. In the **Type** field at the top of the **Document** dialog, select an email template.
3. Complete the remaining fields with the required information.
4. Click the **Create** button to open the new email in your default mail client.
5. If SuperOffice CRM contains an email address for the company/contact you have chosen in the **Document** dialog, this address is inserted automatically in the messageâ€™s **To** field.
    Enter the email addresses of any other recipients you would like to add. You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients][4]).
6. Write the message.
7. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also [add documents from SuperOffice CRM][5].
8. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).

## Create email with predefined email body template

When creating an email from SuperOffice CRM, it is also possible to use predefined SuperOffice templates just for the mail body.

1. Make sure that an email body template is available, and that the **Use SuperOffice email body** option in the **SuperOffice CRM options** dialog is selected.

2. Click the **Email** toolbar button at the bottom of the SuperOffice CRM window. (This also applies if you click an email address in SuperOffice CRM, send an email from the **Contacts** section tab, or reply to/forward an email from the **Activities** section tab.)

3. In the **To** field, enter the email address(es) of the recipient(s). You can also use the **Select recipients** dialog (see [Selecting recipients][4]).

    > [!TIP]
    > If you select several contacts in a list in SuperOffice CRM, and then right-click and select **Send email**, all the contacts are set as recipients of the email.

4. Write the message.

5. Add any attachments you would like to include. You can also [add documents from SuperOffice CRM][5].

6. Click **Send** to send the message to the specified recipient(s).
