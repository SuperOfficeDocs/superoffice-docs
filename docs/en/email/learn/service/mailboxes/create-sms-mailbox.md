# Create SMS mailbox

SuperOffice can import SMS messages. For this to work, you must set up an SMS mailbox:

[!include[Go to email](../../../includes/goto-email.md)]

1. Click **New SMS mailbox**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an SMS mailbox already exists, the **New SMS mailbox** button is not visible.

1. In the **Category** list box, select the default category to apply to requests created from SMS messages.

1. In the **Priority** list box, select which priority to assign to requests received via SMS.

[!include[Set customer language](../includes/step-set-language.md)]

1. Click **OK**. The SMS mailbox is created.
