# Compose an email

![icon][img2]

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can compose a new email message by clicking the **New** button in the top bar.

A simple way to create an email message:

[!include[How to compose an email](includes/howto-compose-email.md)]

When you finished the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:

* To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.
* To send the message and archive it as a document in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens. [How to create a document][1].

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still go to the sent folder and [archive the message][2].
>
> The signature template at the bottom of the message can be edited in ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Edit personal signature**.
