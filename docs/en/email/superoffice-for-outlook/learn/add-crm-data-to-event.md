    If the email or contact is stored in SuperOffice, their contact information will appear, and the **Company** and **Contact** fields will auto-fill. You can hover over the contact and click **Open in CRM** to view detailed information in SuperOffice CRM.

    You can also **invite contacts from SuperOffice** for added convenience.

1. Adjust the event details as needed.

1. Press **Save** to finalize the event.

## Existing event

1. Open an existing event in Outlook.

1. [Open SuperOffice for Outlook][1] (if not pinned)​.

    * If SuperOffice CRM data exists for the attendees, it will be displayed.
    * If no data exists, the add-in will attempt to find the organizer in SuperOffice CRM.

1. Follow the same steps as outlined above to modify or save the event.

> [!NOTE]
> You need [Synchronizer for SuperOffice][2] for this functionality. Calendar events synced from SuperOffice CRM are view-only in Outlook, but you can still view contact information.

1. In the SuperOffice sidebar, navigate to the **Action** or **People** tab and select the contact's name.
