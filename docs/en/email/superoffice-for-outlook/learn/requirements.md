* [Microsoft Outlook for iOS][2] on iOS 13
* [Microsoft Outlook for Android][3] on Android 10

## Limitations

SuperOffice for Outlook works only with main account. Shared mailboxes are not supported.

Versions earlier than 2001 of the Outlook desktop app do not work in Send and Archive, because they lack APIs.

The currently released add-on version (via Microsoft AppSource) does not support mobile phones (the mobile device API).

To get the version that has support for the mobile devices, use one of these options:

* Option a: [centralized deployment][1]
* Option b: [use the pilot version][4]

## Requirements for centralized deployment

Learn more about the requirements forÂ [Centralized Deployment][5] from Microsoft.

If an add-in update significantly increases the scope of data access, you must re-approve it before the update is deployed.
