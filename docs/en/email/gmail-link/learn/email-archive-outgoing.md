# Archive outgoing email

When you send an email, you can also archive it (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of keeping track of your outgoing correspondence.

Follow these steps:

1. In Gmail, click **Compose**.

2. Write the email message.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you send the email to multiple recipients, the email is only archived on the first recipient.

3. Click **Send and archive**. The email is sent.

4. In the dialog **Archive email in SuperOffice**, the **Company** and **Contact** fields are automatically filled if the recipient's email address is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:

    [!include[Archiving options for Gmail](includes/gmail-archiving-options.md)]

    If the recipient of the email is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. A warning also appears if the recipient is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM.

5. Click **Save**. The email (including any attachments) is archived to SuperOffice CRM as a new document. You can then double-click the email in the **Activities** section tab to open it.

Click the link in the pop-up message to open the document in SuperOffice.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not archive the message when you send it, you can still [go to the sent folder and archive the message][3].
