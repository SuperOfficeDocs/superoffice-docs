# Create request

[!include[Requirement](../../../../../common/includes/req-service-essentials.md)]

You can create a request in SuperOffice Service based on an email in your Gmail inbox.

1. In the Gmail inbox, open an email.

2. Click the **More** button ( ![icon][img1] ) in the email toolbar.

3. Select **Create request**.

4. In the **Create request in SuperOffice based on email** dialog, click the request queue where you want to place the request. Each queue has a specific category and priority assigned to it.

5. Click **Save**. A confirmation message appears.
    * If the sender's email address is recognized, the request is automatically linked to the correct contact and company.
    * If the sender's email address is not recognized, the sender is automatically registered as a new contact in SuperOffice Service.

6. In the confirmation message, optionally select **Click here to view it** to look closer at the request in SuperOffice Service.
