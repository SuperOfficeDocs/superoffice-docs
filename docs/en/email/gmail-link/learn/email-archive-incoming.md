# Archive incoming email

You can archive an incoming email (including any attachments) as a document in SuperOffice CRM. This is a convenient way of storing information you receive via email together with other company/contact information in SuperOffice CRM.

1. In the Gmail inbox, select the email you would like to archive.

2. Click ![icon][img1] in the email toolbar.

    If the sender of the email is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. A warning also appears if the sender is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM.

3. In the dialog, the **Company** and **Contact** fields are automatically filled if the sender is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:

    [!include[Archiving options for Gmail](includes/gmail-archiving-options.md)]

4. Click **Save**. The selected email (including any attachments) is archived to SuperOffice CRM as a new document. You can then double-click the email in the **Activities** section tab to open it.

Click the link in the pop-up message to open the document in SuperOffice.
