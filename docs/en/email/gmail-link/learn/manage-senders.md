# Manage senders

## Look up sender to SuperOffice

1. In the Gmail inbox, open an email.
2. Click the arrow button next to the sender's name and email address in the email header.
3. What happens next, depends on whether the sender's email address is found in SuperOffice:
    * If the email address is found on a company/contact, the company/contact card is displayed.
    * If the email address is registered on more than one company/contact, a dialog will appear, listing the alternatives and allowing you to choose one.
    * If the email address is not registered in SuperOffice, you may add it.

## Add a sender's email address to SuperOffice

To add the sender's email address to a new or existing contact in SuperOffice:

1. Follow the look-up procedure above.

2. Click **Add to SuperOffice**.

3. In the **Add email address to SuperOffice** dialog, select one of the following options:

    * **Could it be one of these?** SuperOffice will try to match the sender with existing contacts in the database. Click one of the suggested contacts if it matches the sender.
    * Search: Search for a company or contact you want to add the sender's email address to.
    * **Create new company and contact**: Click this button if the sender is a new contact from a company not previously registered in SuperOffice. Fill in the relevant fields and click **Save**.

4. Click **Save**.

Click the link in the pop-up message to go to the contact in SuperOffice.

## Handle emails from senders not registered in SuperOffice

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure also applies to outgoing emails where the email address of a recipient is not registered in SuperOffice.

If the sender of the email or attachment is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog for archiving email.

1. Click the warning.
2. In the **Add email address to SuperOffice** dialog, select one of the following option:
    * **Could it be one of these?** SuperOffice will try to match the sender with existing contacts in the database. Click one of the suggested contacts if it matches the sender.
    * Search: Search for a company or contact you want to add the sender's email address to.
    * **Create new company and contact**: Click this button if the sender is a new contact from a company not previously registered in SuperOffice. Fill in the relevant fields and click **Save**.
3. Click **Save**.

When you return from the dialog **Add email address to SuperOffice**, the company and contact is filled in and the warning is removed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not want to add the email address to SuperOffice, you can manually select a company and contact.

## Handle emails from senders with several listings

When you archive an email or an attachment, or create an activity based on an email, SuperOffice CRM performs a search to see if the email address matches any of the recorded companies or contacts. If the email address is listed multiple times in SuperOffice CRM, a warning displays in the dialog **Archive email in SuperOffice**. Click the warning to select the correct contact.
