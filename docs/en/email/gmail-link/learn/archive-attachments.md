# Archive attachments

If the attachment is the only part of the email you would like to keep for future reference, it is possible to archive an email attachment in SuperOffice CRM as a document. Follow these steps:

1. In the Gmail inbox, open an email containing one or more attachments.

2. Hold the mouse-pointer over the attachment you want to archive.

3. Click the SuperOffice icon ![icon][img2].

4. In the **Archive attachment as a SuperOffice document** dialog, the **Company** and **Contact** fields is automatically filled if the sender is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields:

    [!include[Archiving options for Gmail](includes/gmail-archiving-options.md)]

    If the sender of the email is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. A warning also appears if the sender is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM.

5. Click **Save**. The selected attachment is archived to SuperOffice CRM as a new document. You can then double-click the document in the **Activities** section tab to open it.
