# Customer service mailboxes

If you have Customer Service and want to migrate your data to our cloud we will create new email addresses for you.

**Why?**

Our cloud solution uses its own email service. This provides your company with your own new email addresses. Your new SuperOffice domain name will be based on your company name:

## How does this affect your company?

Simple! You will have to choose between have 2 alternatives:

* Keep the old email addresses and set up email forwarding to the new email address
* Use the new email addresses generated by SuperOffice

## If you want to keep your old email addresses?

No problem! But if you want to keep the old email addresses you will need to set up forwarding from your old email address to the new address generated by SuperOffice. Contact your current email provider to set this up. To learn how to find your new SuperOffice email addresses: [SuperOffice Mailboxes][2]

Also! If you choose to use your old email addresses, you might need to add an [SPF Record][3].

**Why?**

The purpose of an SPF record is to prevent spammers from sending messages with forged From-addresses in your domain. Without the SPF record, you risk having some emails from your customers ending up as spam.

**How?**

To add the SPF record, forward this information to your domain provider and refer to the following SPF (TXT) record:

```text
v=spf1 include:_spf.online.superoffice.com ~all
```
