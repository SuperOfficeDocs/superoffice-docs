# SMS outbox

The **SMS outbox** tab contains all outgoing SMS messages that have not yet been sent, or that have produced an error.

> [!NOTE]
> If this tab is not visible, this means that you do not have the SMS module installed or that SMS has not been enabled for the license you are using. Contact your system administrator for more information.

The following options are also available from the ![icon][img1] menu button:

* **Export**: Click here to export the list to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.

* **Send**: Click here to resend the selected messages only if there was a fault with the automatic mailing.

* **Delete**: Click here to delete the selected messages.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot undo this operation.

If you click one of the messages in this tab, the **Outbound SMS** screen appears. This contains information about the selected message, such as its size and who created it. Any error messages are also shown.
