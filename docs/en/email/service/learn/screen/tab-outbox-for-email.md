# Outbox for email

In the **Outbox for email** tab is a list of the emails in the queue to be sent out.

Select **Show sent emails** in the lower right corner to display also the last request emails.

The following options are also available from the **Actions** button (![icon][img1]):

* **Export**: Click here to export the list to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.

* **Send**: Click here to resend the selected emails only if there was a fault with the automatic mailing.

* **Delete**: Click here to delete the selected emails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot undo this operation.

If you click one of the messages in this tab, the **Outbound email** screen appears. This contains information about the selected message, such as its size and who created it. Any error messages are also shown.
