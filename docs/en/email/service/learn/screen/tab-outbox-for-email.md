The following options are also available from <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i>:

* **Export**: Used to export the list to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.

* **Send**: Used to resend the selected emails only if there was a fault with the automatic mailing.

* **Delete**: Used to delete the selected emails.
