# Inbox for email

In the **Inbox for email** tab is a list of the emails in the queue to be read in. The following options are also available from the **Actions** button (![icon][img1]):

* **Export**: Click here to export the list to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.

* **Delete**: Click here to delete the selected emails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot undo this operation.

If you click one of the messages in this tab, the **Inbound email** screen appears. This contains information about that message. In the **Last error message** field, you can see what caused the problem, for example, if there is a problem with the email address or the email server. If you get an error from SuperOffice Service, you can click **Import with debug** to display technical information to help user support with troubleshooting.
