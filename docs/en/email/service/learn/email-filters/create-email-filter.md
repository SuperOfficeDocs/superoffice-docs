# Create email filter

[!include[Go to email](../includes/goto-email.md)]

1. Select the **Email filters** tab.

1. Click **New email filter**. The **Properties for email filter** screen appears.

1. In the **Filter** tab, you can specify which emails are to be filtered, by entering the following information:

    * **Description**: Enter a brief description of the email filter.
    * **Priority**: In this list box, you select the filter's priority. A value of 10 is the highest priority and 1 the lowest.
    * **Script**: Here you can select a [script or macro][1] to be run by this filter.

1. Select what the filter applies to:

    * **All incoming email**: If you select this option, the email filter is used for all incoming emails.
    * **Email which contains**: If you select this option, emails containing the fixed expression (regexp) specified in the fields to the right will trigger the email filter. In the list box on the far right, you can choose between the email header and/or email body.

1. In the **Find regular expressions** tab, you can define regular expressions that find text in emails, and save them as variables. To assign the value from a regular expression to a variable named myVariable, use the following format: myVariable = &lt;regexp&gt;.

1. In the **Set links** tab, you can specify how incoming email is linked to a request and/or a contact on the basis of the email content:
    * **Link to contact where**: Here you can link the generated request to a contact based on information from the email. You define these by selecting one of the contact fields in the left-hand list box, and then entering a regular expression that returns the value that identifies the contact.
    * **Link to request where**: Here you can link the email to an existing request based on a regular expression that extracts data from the email.

1. In the **Set values** tab, you can add or replace values for contacts, companies and requests, based on the content of the email:
    1. In the list box on the left, select the required field for the contact, company or request.

    2. In the field on the right, enter one of the following:
        * the regular expression that finds the value to be specified
        * a fixed value (must be prefixed with =)

    3. If you check **Replace**, the value that is found replaces an existing value.

    4. Click **Add** to add the value.

        > [!TIP]
        > You can delete a value again by selecting it and clicking the delete icon ( ![icon][img1] ).

1. In the **Set properties** tab, you can set specific properties for requests that are generated from emails that match the current filter:

1. In the **Email response** tab, you can create different emails to be sent when the filter is triggered. Here you can enter the following information:
    * **Send reply template**: Here you can select which [reply template][2] should be sent if the filter is triggered.
    * **... to contact**: If checked, the selected reply template is sent back to the contact.
    * **... to**: If checked, the selected reply template is sent to the email address specified in the field on the right.
    * **Suggest FAQ entries from**: If checked, the system will [suggest FAQ entries based on the text][3] in incoming emails. The suggested entries are available as template variables and can therefore be reused in the selected reply template. You can also specify which branch of the FAQ tree to search in, by specifying the folder you want.
    * **Block auto-reply**: If checked, the system will not reply automatically to this email.

1. In the **Email boxes** tab, you can select which mailboxes the filter applies to.

1. Click **OK**. The email filter is created.
