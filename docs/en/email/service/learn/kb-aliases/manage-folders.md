# Administrate email address folders

Under **Knowledge Base** > **Email addresses** you can create a folder structure for email addresses, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create subfolders in all folders, and you can place email addresses in any of these folders as appropriate.

## Create folders

[!include[How to create a folder](../../../../learn/includes/howto-create-folder-kb.md)]

You are now ready to [add email addresses to the new folder][1].

## Delete folders

Before you delete an email folder, you must remove all the addresses in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* Delete the addresses. Click the name in the list, and click **Delete** in the **Email address properties** screen.

* Move an email address to another folder by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you edit an address.
