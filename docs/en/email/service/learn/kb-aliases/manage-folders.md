# Administrate email address folders

You can create a folder structure for email addresses, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place email addresses in any of these folders as appropriate.

## Create folders

[!include[How to create a folder](../../../../learn/includes/howto-create-folder-kb.md)]

You are now ready to [add email addresses to the new folder][1].

## Delete folders

Before you delete an email folder, you must remove all the addresses in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* Delete the addresses. Click the name in the list, and click **Delete** in the **Email address properties** screen.

* Move an email address to another folder by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you edit an address.
