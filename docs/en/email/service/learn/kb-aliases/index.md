# Work with email addresses

Under **Knowledge Base** > **Email addresses** you can create a list of email addresses that you often use, but which are not registered for users or contacts in SuperOffice Service. For example, suppliers, partners, or product specialists. These addresses are accessible in most places where you send emails, such as in the **New request** and **Add message** screens.

## List email addresses

If you want details of the registered email addresses, select **Knowledge Base** > **Email addresses**. This takes you to the **Email addresses** screen, which contains email addresses in a folder structure that you can create yourself.

* To **create** a new email address, see [Create email addresses][2].
* To **edit** an existing email address, click the name in the list.
* To **search for** an email address, click the **Search** button.
* To **delete** an email address, click the name in the list, and click **Delete** in the **Email address properties** screen.
