# Create email address

When you register email addresses under **Knowledge base** > **Email addresses**, they become available in most places where you send emails, such as in the **New request** and **Add message** screens. This speeds up request processing.

1. Go to ![icon][img2] **Main menu** in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **Email addresses**.

1. Go to the folder you want to put the email address in. If it does not yet exist, you can [create a new folder][1].

1. Click the **New email address** button. This takes you to the **Email address properties** screen.

1. The **Folder** field automatically shows the name of the folder you chose. If you change your mind, you can click the ![icon][img1] list button and select a different folder in the list that appears.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the person the email address belongs to.

1. In the **Email address** field, enter the person's email address.
