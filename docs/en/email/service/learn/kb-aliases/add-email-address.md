# Create email address

When you register email addresses under **Knowledge Base** > **Email addresses**, they become available in most places where you send emails, such as in the **New request** and **Add message** screens. This speeds up request processing.

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Email addresses**.

2. Go to the folder you want to put the email address in. If it does not yet exist, you can [create a new folder][1].

3. Click the **New email address** button. This takes you to the **Email address properties** screen.

4. The **Folder** field automatically shows the name of the folder you chose. If you change your mind, you can click the list button ( ![icon][img1] ) and select a different folder in the list that appears.

5. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the person the email address belongs to.

6. In the **Email address** field, enter the person's email address.

7. <!-- online --> In the **Mobile phone number** field, you can enter their mobile number. This can be used to send messages by SMS.

8. Click **OK**. The email address is added to the specified folder and available the next time you want to send an email.
