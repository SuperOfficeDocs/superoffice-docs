In this tutorial, the record will be set up for Google Apps. We will use:

* Mailgun as our mail service (the email service to use to send the email - permitted to send email on behalf of your domain).
* Google Workspace domain email address to "send as" (your 'domain' as the sending email, in other words, what you see in 'from' address in your mailings and email).
