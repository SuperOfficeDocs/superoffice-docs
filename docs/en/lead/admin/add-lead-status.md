# Manage lead statuses

[!include[Must be admin](../../learn/includes/req-admin.md)]

The **Contact – Lead status** list defines the qualification stages available to sales and marketing teams when working with leads. Each status represents a distinct point in the lead process and appears in the **Lead status** field on contact cards when the company's category belongs to the *Potential customer* group with **Enable lead status** selected.

Grouping and filtering by user group are not available for this list.

## Add a lead status

1. Select <i class="ph ph-list-bullets" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Lists** in the Navigator.

1. From the dropdown menu, choose **Contact – Lead status**. The **Items** tab displays all existing statuses.

1. Click **Add** to open the **Edit list item** dialog.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the new status. *(Mandatory)*

1. *(Optional)* Enter a short description to clarify how the status should be used.

    The description is shown as a tooltip when the user hovers over a status name.

1. Click **OK** to save or **Cancel** to discard your changes.
