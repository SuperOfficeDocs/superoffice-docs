# Add Follow-up type

Follow-up types are defined in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance. The types are displayed as items in the **Follow-up - Type** list.

## Steps

1. Select <i class="ph ph-list-bullets" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Lists** in the Navigator.

1. Select **Follow-up - Type** from the dropdown menu. The **Items** tab displays all existing follow-up types.

1. Click **Add** to open the **Edit list item** dialog.

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field. *(Mandatory)*

1. Click <i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Chevron"></i> next to the **Type** field and select the required follow-up type from the list box.

1. In the **Direction** field, specify if the follow-up is outgoing or incoming by clicking the arrow and choosing from the list box.

1. In the **Color** field, choose which background color this follow-up type should have in the Diary screen. This setting will then apply across the organization.

1. In the **Intention** field, click the arrow and select one of the predefined options from the list box. These items are used in connection with status monitors in SuperOffice CRM (requires a licence for [SAINT][2]).

1. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

1. Click **Save** to apply your changes or **Cancel** to discard them.

## Intention

* Check the **All day** option if you want it to be possible to select a duration of a whole day for the follow-up type in the follow-ups dialog in SuperOffice CRM.

* Check the **Free** option if you want it to be possible to specify free and busy times for the follow-up type in the follow-ups dialog in SuperOffice CRM.

* Check the **Publish** option if you want it to be possible to specify, in the follow-ups dialog in SuperOffice CRM, that the follow-up in question should be made available to external users.

> [!TIP]
> You can create new options in addition to the predefined ones by adding them to the **Follow-up - Intention** list in Settings and maintenance.
