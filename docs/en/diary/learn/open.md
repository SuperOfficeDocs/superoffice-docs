# View diary

The diary in SuperOffice CRM is fundamentally a personal diary. Your name is displayed at the upper right of the Diary screen.

You can open another user's diary, or the diary of an available resource, to see when they are free, for example, or to create follow-ups for them directly.

You can also view the diaries of other users and resources in your organization by displaying group views in your diary.

## View another diary

If you click on the name of a user or resource, this user or resource becomes the owner of the diary, and you are taken directly to the **Day** tab of this user or resource. To return to your own diary, select your name from the diary owner list.

1. Click your name in any tab in the Diary screen. A list box is displayed containing other resources, user groups and users who are connected to the network. This is called the *diary owner list*.

    > [!TIP]
    > Using FastSearcher, you can search for users by name or user ID.

2. Select a resource or user directly, or click a user group ![icon][img1]. You can then select from a list of all people linked to this group of SuperOffice CRM users.

3. The diary of the other user or resource opens and their name (not your own) is displayed at the upper right of the Diary screen. The activities list of the other user or resource is also displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> Other users are displayed with the ![icon][img2] icon and red underlining, while resources are displayed with the ![icon][img3] icon and blue underlining.

When you open the diary of another user or resource, you can switch between the different tabs as in your own diary, and you can [create follow-ups][2] in their diaries by clicking and selecting time periods with the mouse, provided that you have the access rights.

## View multiple diaries (group view)

1. Click the **View** tab in the Diary screen.

2. Click the **Show** list box at the bottom of the Diary screen. This brings up a list of all the groups and resources that are set up in your organization.

3. Select the required group from the list. The **View** tab now contains the diaries of all the users and resources in the selected user group.
