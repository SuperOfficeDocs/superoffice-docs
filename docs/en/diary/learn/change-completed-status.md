# Change Completed status of an activity

When you consider that an activity is finished, you can mark it as completed.

**Completed** is a toggle option, which you activate and deactivate using the same menu option or shortcut key. A tick specifies that the activity is **Completed**.

**Steps:**

1. Open the activity and uncheck the **Completed** icon at the top-right of the dialog.

    For details, see [Open follow-ups][1] and [Open documents][2].

1. Hold the mouse pointer over the box in the **Completed** column (![icon][img2]) in the **Activities** section tab. Then click the checkbox ( ![icon][img1] ).

1. Right-click the activity and choose **Completed**.
