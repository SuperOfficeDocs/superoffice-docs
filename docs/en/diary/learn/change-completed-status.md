# Change Completed status of an activity

When you consider that an activity is finished, you can mark it as completed.

**Completed** is a toggle option, which you activate and deactivate using the same menu option or shortcut key. A tick specifies that the activity is **Completed**.

## Steps

1. Do one of the following:

    * Right-click the activity and choose **Completed**.
    * Mark the checkbox in the **Completed** column in the **Activities** section tab.
    * Open the follow-up and select **Completed**.

1. Mark/clear the checkbox in the footer of the Follow-up dialog.
