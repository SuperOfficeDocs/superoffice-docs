# Delegate

An assigned follow-up is one you have delegated to someone else.

Examples: Your colleague is on vacation, but needs to call a client when they get back. You arranged a meeting with a client, but you need to delegate it to someone else.

**Options:**

* Assign a follow-up to someone (change owner)
* Re-assign a follow-up
* [Create a meeting in an associate's diary][2]

## Assign a follow-up

1. [Open or create a follow-up][1].

1. Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button and select **Assign to**. Alternatively, open the follow-up and update the name in the **Owner** field.

1. In The **Assign to** dialog, click the list at the top to select which users to display (history list, all, or groups).

1. Select a person from the list. A conflict icon indicates that a person has another follow-up at the given time.

1. Click **OK** and **Save**.

The selected person is now the owner of the follow-up. They [receive a notification][3] and see the follow-up in their diary and activities list.

## Re-assign

If the other person declines the invitation, you get an **Invitation declined** notification.

1. Click **Got it** to acknowledge. You are now the owner.

2. Optionally, repeat the steps to re-assign the follow-up to someone else.
