# Assign a follow-up to someone else

If you are creating a follow-up on behalf of someone else, you can change the owner of the follow-up (that is, assign the follow-up to someone else).

Examples: Your colleague is on vacation, but need to phone a client when they get back. You arranged a meeting with a client, but you need to delegate it to someone else.

1. [Open or create a follow-up][1].

1. Select owner. Do one of the following:

    * Select the **Details** tab and click the name in the **Owner** field.
    * Click the **Task** button ( ![icon][img1] ) and select **Assign to**.

1. In The **Assign to** dialog, click the list at the top to select which users to display (history list, all or groups).

1. Select a person from the list. A conflict icon indicates if a person has another follow-up at the given time.

1. Click **OK** and **Save**.

The selected person is now the owner of the follow-up, and will see the follow-up in their diary and activities list.
