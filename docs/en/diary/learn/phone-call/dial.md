# Dial contacts

If your IP phone solution is correctly configured (see [Phone preferences][1]), you can call a contact directly from SuperOffice CRM.

## Dial a contact from the Appointment, Task, Phone Call and Document dialogs

You do this using the telephone button in, for example, the **Appointment**, **Task**, **Phone Call** and **Document** dialogs:

1. Open an appointment, task, phone call or document.
2. Select the required contact in the **Contact** field in the dialog.
3. Click the button next to the contact field ![icon][img1]. A list of numbers for the selected contact is displayed.
4. Select the number you want to call. The contact is then dialled.

## Call from section tabs (to contacts, selection members, stakeholders, participants)

1. Go to a section tab containing contacts.
2. Click a phone number in a column containing phone numbers. The contact is then dialled.
