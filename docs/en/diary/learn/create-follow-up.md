# Add follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls)

To create follow-ups in SuperOffice CRM, click the **New** button on the top bar.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add follow-ups by double-clicking an empty line in the **Activities** section tab. By default this opens the **Appointment** dialog. You can specify which dialog should open under **Preferences** (![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Functions** > **Type from Activities section tab**).

## Create follow-ups in the activities list

To create a new follow-up directly in the activities list, double-click an empty row below the last activity in the list.

If no empty row is displayed at the bottom of the activities list, enlarge the activities list:

1. Position the mouse pointer between the section tabs and the card above. The pointer changes to a double-headed arrow.

2. Click and drag the line upwards until you see more empty rows at the bottom of the activities list.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify a time or duration for a follow-up you are creating from within the activities list, it is entered in the Diary.

## <a id="associate" />Create appointment for an associate

When you open the diary of an associate, you can create appointments for this person yourself.

1. Click the **View** tab in the **Diary** screen.

2. [Find the person's diary][4] in the **View**.

3. [Create a new appointment][1] in this diary using the mouse.

4. The **Appointment** dialog opens. [Choose the participants to include][5], if they are not automatically included.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you checked **Participants from group view** under **Preferences**, all members of the view are automatically added as participants in the appointment. To change this preference, go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Functions** and set the **Participants from group view** preference to **Yes**. Click **Save**.

5. Enter the required information in the fields. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)]

6. Click the **Save** button. The appointment will be displayed in the selected person's diary.

## <a id="overlap" />Create overlapping follow-ups

Follow-ups may overlap each other. When you try to record an overlapping follow-up, the dialog has an exclamation mark ![icon][img2] next to the start and stop fields as a reminder (you can still record the follow-up).

A suggestion for the first vacant time slot is shown. Click the proposed time to the right of **First available** to select this time instead.

Overlapping follow-ups are displayed in the **Diary** screen so that you can see part of each follow-up.
