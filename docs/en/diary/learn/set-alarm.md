# Set alarms for follow-ups

SuperOffice CRM can notify you before your meeting is about to start. When it is time to start your meeting, a notification will pop up. If it is a video meeting, you can start your video meeting by clicking the notification pop-up.

## To be notified of a follow-up in advance

1. Check the **Alarm** checkbox in the **Details** tab in the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog.
1. In the field next to the checkbox, add the number of hours and minutes ahead of your meeting you wish to be notified.

    The default is 10 minutes, but you can change it.

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid the sound of the alarm disturbing your colleagues, you can set it to switch off after a certain time. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings > Preferences > Diary** and edit the **Silent after** option.

When the notification time arrives, the **Alarm** dialog opens, containing information about the company, date, time, type, priority and location.

## Options in the Alarm dialog

* Click **OK** to confirm that you have seen the information.
* Click **Show** to open the follow-ups dialog and display more information.
* Check **Remind me in 5 minutes** and click **OK** to repeat the alarm.
