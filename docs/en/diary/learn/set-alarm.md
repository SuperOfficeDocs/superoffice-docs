# Set alarms for follow-ups

To be notified of a follow-up in advance, check the **Alarm** checkbox in the **Details** tab in the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog. The field next to the checkbox specifies the number of hours and minutes before the follow-up is due. The default is 10 minutes, but you can change it.

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid the sound of the alarm disturbing your colleagues, you can set it to switch off after a certain time. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings > Preferences > Diary** and edit the **Silent after** option.

[!include[Recurrence](includes/note-repetition.md)]

When the notification time arrives, the **Alarm** dialog opens, containing information about the company, date, time, type, priority and location.

## Options in the Alarm dialog

* Click **OK** to confirm that you have seen the information.
* Click **Show** to open the follow-ups dialog and display more information.
* Check **Remind me in 5 minutes** and click **OK** to repeat the alarm.
