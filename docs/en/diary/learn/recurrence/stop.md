# Stop repeating follow-up

## Stop repeating (keep this instance)

When you stop the repeating follow-up, all instances of the follow-up *after* the one you edited are deleted. If the follow-up is the first in a series of repeating follow-ups, the repeating pattern is deleted and it becomes an "ordinary" follow-up.

1. Open the follow-up from the Diary or on the **Activities** section tab.
1. Click the repeat icon ![icon][img1].
1. Click **Stop repeating**.
1. Click **Save** in the **Follow-up** dialog to save all changes.

## Delete this and all future instances

You can also stop a repeating follow-up by selecting it in the diary and deleting it.

1. Select the required follow-up.
2. Right-click and choose **Delete**.
3. Select **Delete all future instances including this one**.
4. Click **Yes** to confirm.
