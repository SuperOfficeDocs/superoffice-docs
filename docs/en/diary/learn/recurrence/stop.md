# Stop repeating follow-up

## Stop repeating (keep this instance)

When you stop the repeating follow-up, all instances of the follow-up *after* the one you edited are deleted. If the follow-up is the first in a series of repeating follow-ups, the repeating pattern is deleted and it becomes an "ordinary" follow-up.
