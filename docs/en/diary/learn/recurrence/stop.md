# Stop repeating follow-up

## Stop repeating (keep this instance)

When you stop the repeating follow-up, all instances of the follow-up *after* the one you edited are deleted. If the follow-up is the first in a series of repeating follow-ups, the repeating pattern is deleted and it becomes an "ordinary" follow-up.

1. Open the follow-up from the Diary or the **Activities** section tab.

1. Do one of the following:

    * Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **Stop repeating**.
    * Click the frequency link next to <i class="ph ph-arrows-clockwise" aria-label="Repeat"></i>, then click the **Stop repeating** button in the dialog that opens.

1. Confirm the action by clicking **Yes** in the confirmation dialog.

1. In the **Follow-up** dialog, click **Save** to apply your changes.

## Delete this and all future instances

You can also stop a repeating follow-up by selecting it in the diary and deleting it.

1. Select the required follow-up.
2. Right-click and choose **Delete**.
3. Select **Delete all future instances including this one**.
4. Click **Yes** to confirm.
