# Repeating follow-ups

It may happen that you want to create a series of follow-ups to occur at regular intervals, for example, a weekly status meeting. Instead of recording these meetings one at a time, you can use the repeating follow-ups function.

## <a id="frequency" />Frequency

**Frequency** is how the follow-up is repeated. The pattern can be daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or repeat at a user-defined interval. The options available for each frequency vary.

### Daily

If you select **Daily**, you can specify that the follow-up should repeat every working day, every day of the week, or at a user-defined interval, such as every other day.

| Option | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Every workday (Mon-Fri) | The follow-up repeats at the same time on each working day. | |
| Every weekday (Mon-Sun) | The follow-up repeats at the same time on each day of the week, including the weekend. | |
| Every &lt;number&gt; day(s) | The number of days between each meeting. | Every 6 days. |

### Weekly

If you select **Weekly**, you can specify that the follow-up should repeat at a user-defined weekly interval, such as every three weeks, and on which day of the week it should take place.

| Option | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Every &lt;number&gt; week(s)| The number of weeks between each meeting. | Every 3 weeks. |
| &lt;weekday&gt;| On which weekday(s) the meeting takes place. | Every Tuesday. |

### Monthly

If you select **Monthly**, you can specify on which day of the month the follow-up should repeat, for example, on the 5th of the month, and a user-defined monthly interval, such as every 4th month. You can also specify that the follow-up should repeat, for example, on the fourth Wednesday of the month.

| Option | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Day &lt;number&gt; of every &lt;number&gt; month(s) | The follow-up takes place on the same date each time. | Day 20 of every 3 months. |
| &lt;ordinal number&gt; &lt;weekday&gt; of every &lt;number&gt; month(s)| The follow-up takes place on the same weekday each time. | The fourth Thursday of every 2 months. |

### Yearly

If you select **Yearly**, you can specify on which day and month the follow-up should repeat each year, for example, every 23rd of September.

| Option | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Day &lt;number&gt; of &lt;month&gt; | The follow-up takes place on the same date each time. | Day 13 of April. |
| &lt;ordinal number&gt; &lt;weekday&gt; of &lt;month&gt; | The follow-up takes place on the same weekday each time. | The fourth Thursday of August. |
