# Create repeating follow-up

It may happen that you want to create a series of appointments to occur at regular intervals, for example, a weekly status meeting. Instead of recording these meetings one at a time, you can use the repeating follow-ups function.

> [!TIP]
> All [frequency options are described in the reference][4].

1. Open the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog and [enter the required information][5].

2. Select the **Details** tab.

3. Click the word **Never** to the right of the **Recurrence** field.

4. At the top right of the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog, the start date and time for the follow-up as well as the end time are displayed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can change only the start date for the follow-up here. To change the time, first close the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog and then change the time in the **Appointment**, **Task**, or **Phone call** dialog.

5. Under **Frequency** you specify if the follow-up should be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or at a user-defined interval. Then select further details for frequency in the field in the middle of the dialog. The options available here depend on what you select under **Frequency**:
    * If you select **Daily**, you can specify that the follow-up should repeat every working day, every day of the week, or at a user-defined interval, such as every other day.

    * If you select **Weekly**, you can specify that the follow-up should repeat at a user-defined weekly interval, such as every three weeks, and on which day of the week it should take place.

    * If you select **Monthly**, you can specify on which day of the month the follow-up should repeat, for example, on the 5th of the month, and a user-defined monthly interval, such as every 4th month. You can also specify that the follow-up should repeat, for example, on the fourth Wednesday of the month.

    * If you select **Yearly**, you can specify on which day and month the follow-up should repeat each year, for example, every 23rd of September.

    * If you select **Custom**, you can manually enter the dates you require. Select the day in the calendar and click the arrow (![icon][img2]) to add it to the list of selected dates. To delete a date, select the date in the list and click **Delete**.

6. In the **Repeating follow-ups ends** field, choose if the follow-up should stop after a specific number of times or after a specific date.

7. Optionally, change one or more dates manually in the list of selected dates, for example, if there is a conflict.

    **Options:**

    * Move a date: Select the date you want to move, and click **Later** ( ![icon][img3] ) to defer the follow-up by one day, or **Earlier** ( ![icon][img4] ) to bring the follow-up one day forwards.

    * Add a date: Click the **Add** button below the list. The same calendar is then displayed as when you select **Custom**. Select the required date and click the arrow button ( ![icon][img2] ) to the right of the calendar to add the date to the list. Use the arrow buttons ( ![icon][img5] ![icon][img6] ) on either side of the month name in the calendar to display other months.

    * Delete a date: Select the date you want to delete, and click the **Delete** button below the list. The date will then be removed from the list of dates.

8. After entering dates for the follow-up, click **OK** to save the dates and close the dialog, or click **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving the dates.

9. Click **Save** in the **Appointment** dialog to save the changes you have made.

In the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone call** dialog, the text next to the **Recurrence** field will show what sort of repetition you specified for the follow-up, for example, **Monthly (23.09.2016 - 23.09.2017)**.
