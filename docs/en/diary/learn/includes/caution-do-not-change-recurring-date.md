> Modifying the start or end date on a recurring meeting after it has been saved is a bad idea. Changing the time on a recurring meeting will work fine, but changing the date will only lead to confusion. **Changing the start time on a meeting will trigger an update on all subsequence recurrences** if you have set the update mode to this-and-forward.
