# Diary

The SuperOffice diary consists of a calendar and a todo list and is used similar to a Filofax with separate pages for every day, week, and month.

* **Calendar**: shows entries allocated to a particular time or date.
* **Todo list**: shows stuff that you have not yet completed, mostly calls and to-dos without time or date.

The diary is a useful tool when you want to plan and perform different types of activities. From the diary, you can view, edit and delete [activities][16]. You also get a [list of sales][13] to work on, using the **Sales** section tab in the Diary screen.

Regular use of the diary, connecting activities to a contact or a company, ensures that you and your team can stay organized effortlessly, promoting smooth collaboration and heightened productivity.

## <a id="open"></a>View diary

To open your diary, click the word **Diary** in the Navigator and select a time period from the list, or click **Today** or **This week** to move to the current day or week. Your name is displayed at the upper right of the Diary screen. If two or more follow-ups overlap, you can see part of each follow-up.

You can access the diary of another user or an available resource to check their availability or create follow-ups directly. To view multiple diaries at once, create a [group view][2].

## <a id="nav"></a>Navigate in the Diary screen

The diary consists of [four tabs][24]: **Day** tab, **Week** tab, **Month** tab, and **View** tab. Switching between these views is easy: simply click the tabs at the top of the Diary screen. The relevant day, week, or month is displayed at the top of the page, depending on which tab you selected.

* In the **Day** tab, **Week** tab, and **Month** tab, click **Today** or **This week** to move to the current day or week.

* Click a month, week number, or day in the calendar to move directly to one of the tabs.

* Click the previous/next buttons ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] at the lower right of the Diary.

* (If open) click a day or week in the day, week, or month view in the side panel.
