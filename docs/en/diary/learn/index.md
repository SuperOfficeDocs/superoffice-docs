# Diary

The Diary screen is the central hub of SuperOffice CRM for managing [follow-ups][1] (meetings, tasks, or calls). It consists of a calendar and a to-do list that help you stay organized and productive.

The Diary combines the following key components:

* **Calendar:** Shows follow-ups scheduled for specific dates and times. It is similar to a Filofax, with separate pages for every day, week, and month.
* **To-do list:** Shows (uncompleted) activities without specific times, such as calls and to-dos, and sales. This acts as a to-do list.

With its flexible views, the Diary ensures seamless collaboration, allowing you to plan your day, week, or month with ease.

## <a id="open"></a>Open diary

To open your diary, click the word **Diary** in the Navigator and select a time period from the list, or click **Today** or **This week** to move to the current day or week. Your name is displayed on the right side of the Diary header.

Follow-ups are displayed in the Diary as colored time blocks, representing their type and duration. Each block includes details such as the company, type, and agenda. Double-click a follow-up to open it.

The following symbols provide visual cues about follow-up details or actions you can take:

| Symbol | Description | Read more |
|:-:|---|---|
| <i class="ph ph-arrows-clockwise" aria-label="Recurring follow-up"></i> | This is a recurring follow-up. | [Schedule recurring follow-ups][8] |
| <i class="ph ph-user-circle" aria-label="Multiple attendees"></i> | The follow-up has several attendees. | [Invite your associates to a follow-up][11] |
| <i class="ph ph-check" aria-label="Completed follow-up"></i> | The follow-up is completed. | [Change Completed status of an activity][7] |
| <i class="ph ph-bell" aria-label="Follow-up alarm"></i> | The follow-up has an active alarm. | |
| <i class="ph ph-question" aria-label="Unanswered invitations"></i> | There are unanswered invitations for this follow-up. | [Status of invitations][10] |
| <i class="ph ph-video-camera" aria-label="Video meeting"></i> | This follow-up is a video meeting. To join the meeting, right-click the follow-up and select **Join meeting**. | [Work with video meetings][6] |

Administrators define follow-up types, including their colors, in **Settings and maintenance**.

## <a id="nav"></a>Navigating the Diary

You can easily move between dates or time periods in the Diary:

* Select the **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** tab to adjust the calendar's detail level. The Diary header updates to show the relevant day, week, or month for the selected view.

* Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons (<i class="ph ph-caret-circle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="ph ph-caret-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>) to navigate forward or backward.

* To quickly jump to a specific date, week, or month:
  * Click a specific date to open the **Day** tab for that date.
  * Click a week number to display that week in the **Week** tab.
  * Click a month (available in the side panel) to switch to the **Month** tab for that month.

* Click **Today** or **This week** to return to the current day or week.

## <a id="tabs"></a>Tabs in the Diary

The Diary offers four main calendar views. Use these tabs to switch between different perspectives:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD051 -->
### [Day tab](#tab/day)

The **Day tab** displays a single day with hourly intervals along the left edge. This view is ideal for managing your schedule hour by hour.

![Diary screen, Day tab -screenshot][img2]

Key features:

* Easily navigate to different dates using the **Today** button or the **Previous** and **Next** buttons (<i class="ph ph-caret-circle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="ph ph-caret-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

* Add or reschedule follow-ups by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.

### [Week tab](#tab/week)

The **Week tab** displays one week at a time, showing days as columns and hours as rows.

![Diary screen, Week tab -screenshot][img3]

Key features:

* Quickly access a specific day by clicking the day header.
* View overlapping follow-ups clearly within the same time block.

> [!TIP]
> To change the first day of the week (Sunday or Monday), go to <i class="ph ph-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.

### [Month tab](#tab/month)

The **Month tab** provides an overview of all follow-ups scheduled in a given month.

![Diary screen, Month tab -screenshot][img4]

Key features:

* Hover over follow-ups to display tooltips with additional details.
* Click a date to drill down into the **Day tab** for more details.

### [View tab](#tab/view)

The **View tab** lets you view and manage group schedules and check availability.

![Diary screen, View tab -screenshot][img5]

Key features:

* **Group views:** Combine schedules for multiple users or resources in a single view. Select a predefined group from the list (<i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Dropdown icon"></i>) or create and manage custom group views using the **Task** menu (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

* **Display modes:** Switch between the side-by-side view and the scheduling grid using the toggle buttons (<i class="ph ph-columns" aria-label="Columns"></i>/<i class="ph ph-rows" aria-label="Rows"></i>) in the upper-right corner.

For detailed steps to create and manage group views, see [Group view][2].

> [!TIP]
> When in a group view, you can create follow-ups for others directly in the calendar.

At the lower left of the calendar is a field for selecting a [time zone][20], if time zones have been enabled.

## <a id="section-tabs"></a>Section tabs in the Diary screen

The lower part of the Diary screen consists of section tabs that together make up your to-do list. These include:

* **Activities:** Acts as a to-do list, showing follow-ups that are not assigned specific times for the selected associate. See [Activities section tab][12].

* **Sales:** Provides an overview of sales progress and scheduled activities related to sales for the selected associate. It emphasizes tracking progress and managing upcoming tasks. See [Sales section tab][13].

The Diary section tabs can be displayed either below the calendar or as a fifth calendar view - the **To-do list** tab - depending on your preferences.

When displayed *below* the calendar (classic), the section tabs remain visible regardless of the selected Diary tab, allowing you to efficiently preview sales or follow-ups in the side panel while planning in the calendar. When displayed *inside* as a view (new), you conserve space for the calendar itself.

## Side panel in the Diary

The [side panel][17] is located on the right side of the Diary screen and provides quick access to additional tools like the monthly calendar, follow-up previews, or the SuperOffice Copilot.

Selecting a date, week, or month in the side panel updates the Diary view to match. Similarly, navigating through the Diary updates the side panel accordingly.

## Personal preferences

You can customize the Diary to suit your workflow:

1. Go to <i class="ph ph-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.

1. Select **Default values** and adjust settings such as:
    * Duration and type for new meetings.
    * Title for new to-dos.
    * The maximum number of follow-ups to show in **Day** view.

1. Select **Diary** and adjust settings such as:
    * Default alarm times
    * Start and end times for all-day events
    * First day of the week (Sunday or Monday)
    * Whether to display the to-do list below the Diary or as a tab

1. Select **Functions** and adjust settings such as:
    * Show week numbers in calendars.
    * The number of days ahead to show items in the **Activities** and **Sales** section tabs.
    * Mark overdue activities.

    * Remove completed activities.

## Tips for efficiency

* Access another user's or resource's diary to check their availability or create follow-ups directly. For a combined view of multiple diaries, create a [group view][2].

* Minimize distractions by collapsing the side panel and/or the Navigator with the toggle button (<i class="ph ph-sidebar-simple" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

* Use the Diary to view, edit, and delete [activities][16] as needed, ensuring your schedule stays up-to-date.

* Regularly connect activities to a contact or company to maintain a clear record of your team's interactions and promote smooth collaboration.

* Use the sticky section tabs below the calendar to preview and manage sales or to-dos while looking through your calendar.

* Switch between side-by-side and scheduling grid views in the **View tab** to choose the layout that best fits your planning needs.

> [!TIP]
> Take advantage of the **Preferences** menu to customize the Diary layout, adjust time settings, or enable features like alarms on follow-ups.
