# Work with video meetings

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can use this feature, the administrator must first configure your preferred video meeting service (Jitsi Meet, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams) in SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance.

## Create a video meeting

You can easily set up a video meeting when creating a follow up:

1. Go to the **Follow-up** dialog (example: go to the diary and create a new appointment).

2. Click ![icon][img1] next to the meeting type (for instance **Business meeting**). The icon changes to ![icon][img2] and a video meeting link is added.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The first time you select the video icon (![icon][img1]), you must log in to authenticate your user in the video meeting service defined by your administrator.

3. [Complete the information in the dialog][2].

If you turned on email invitations for the participants of the follow-up, an email with a link to join the video meeting is sent when the appointment is saved. In the diary, follow-ups with video meetings are displayed with the icon ![icon][img3].

> [!TIP]
> Click ![icon][img4] to copy the video meeting link. You can then paste the link in the description of the appointment or send to others via direct messaging. Use the template variable {burl} to add the video meeting link to invitation templates.

## Join video meetings

You can join a video meeting in SuperOffice in several ways:

* Click **Join meeting** in the **Follow-up** dialog (appointment)
* Click **Join meeting** in the side panel
* Click a browser notification (only available if the **Alarm** option has been activated)
