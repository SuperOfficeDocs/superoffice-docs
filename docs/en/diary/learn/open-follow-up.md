# Open follow-ups

Open an existing follow-up by double-clicking it:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD032 -->
[!include[List of Activities section tabs](../../learn/includes/list-activities-section-tabs.md)]
* On the different tabs in the Diary screen.
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

This brings up the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog, depending on the type of follow-up.
