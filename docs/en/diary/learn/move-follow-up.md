# Move a follow-up

[!include[Note](includes/note-edit-followup.md)]

At some time, you will undoubtedly need to move follow-ups from one time slot to another, from the activities list to the **Diary** screen, or from the **Diary** screen to the activities list. These actions can be accomplished quickly and easily in SuperOffice CRM by dragging and dropping with the mouse.

> [!NOTE]
> You can move only one follow-up at a time, and only follow-ups that are not completed. [How to change Completed status of an activity][1].

## Move to a different time or day

1. Select the required tab in the **Diary** screen (**Day**, **Week**, **Month** or **View**).

2. Drag and drop the required follow-up to a different time.

> [!TIP]
> You can check the time and duration for a follow-up by holding the mouse pointer over it in the **Diary** screen. This displays a tooltip containing information about the follow-up.

## Move from one week or month to another

* Select the **Week** or **Month** view in the side panel, go to the required week or month and then drag the follow-up from the Diary to the required day in the side panel. The diary automatically updates with the required week or month.

* Move the follow-up temporarily to the activities list, go to the required week or month and then drag the follow-up back to the required day in the Diary.

## Move from the activities list to the Diary

You can move a follow-up from the activities list to the Diary. This can be useful if you moved a follow-up from the Diary to the activities list and want it back in the Diary, for example, on a different date.

1. Select the required tab in the **Diary** screen (**Day**, **Week**, **Month** or **View**).

2. Grab the follow-up in the activities list by clicking down on it with the mouse button.

3. Drag the follow-up to the required time and/or day in the Diary and release the mouse button. The follow-up is entered in the Diary. It is removed from the [activities list][2] if the criteria for inclusion in the activities list are no longer fulfilled.

> [!TIP]
> Select the **Week** or **Month** view in the side panel, go to the required week or month in the Diary and then drag the follow-up from the Diary to the required day in the side panel. The diary automatically updates with the required week or month.

If you entered a follow-up in the Diary but are not yet sure of the time or date to allocate to it, you can enter it in the activities list temporarily. Move the follow-up from the Diary to the activities list using drag and drop.
