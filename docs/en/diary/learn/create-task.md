# Create a task

1. Select **New** > **Task** on the [top bar][2].

2. In the **Task** dialog, [specify the task details][1].

When you create a new task, no time is displayed in the **Start** and **Due** fields. Today's date is inserted automatically, but you can change it to the required date. The date indicates the deadline for the task.
