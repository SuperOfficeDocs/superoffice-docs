# Group view

The **Group view** in the Diary allows you to view and manage multiple users' or resources' schedules in a single calendar view. Use group views to streamline planning, check availability, and create follow-ups directly for team members or resources.

## View multiple diaries

1. Go to the **View** tab in the Diary screen.

1. Select a group from the list (<i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Dropdown icon"></i>).

   * Predefined groups are based on your organization's setup and include user groups or resources, such as departments or conference rooms.

1. The selected group's diaries will be displayed in the **View** tab, where you can check schedules or plan follow-ups.

## Create a new group view

1. Go to the **View** tab in the Diary screen.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **New group view**.

    Alternatively, select **Copy** to base the new view on an existing one.

1. In the **New group view** dialog, enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for your group view.

1. Choose who and which resources to include in the group view. You have several options:

    * **Associates:** Select a user from your organization, then click <i class="ph ph-caret-circle-right" aria-label="Arrow right"></i> to add them to the view. You can filter the list by user group to find people more easily.

    * **Project:** Choose a project, select a project member, then click <i class="ph ph-caret-circle-right" aria-label="Arrow right"></i> to add them to the view.

    * **Resource:** Select a resource, such as a meeting room or equipment, then click <i class="ph ph-caret-circle-right" aria-label="Arrow right"></i> to add it to the view.

    > [!TIP]
    > Click **Select all** to select everyone in the list and add them to the view in one action.

1. Rearrange the group order if needed: Select a person or resource, then use <i class="ph ph-caret-circle-up" aria-label="Move up"></i> and <i class="ph ph-caret-circle-down" aria-label="Move down"></i> to adjust their position. This order determines how they are displayed in the **View** tab.

1. Click **Save** to finalize the group view or **Cancel** to discard changes.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Task** menu to manage existing views. You can **Copy** pre-defined groups and **Edit** or **Delete** groups that you created.

## Which diaries can I include?

When creating a group view, you can include any combination of associates, resources, or project members:

* **Associates:** Add team members or colleagues to monitor their schedules.
* **Project members:** Add members of a specific project to focus on team availability.
* **Resources:** Include shared resources like meeting rooms or equipment. The resource list is defined in Settings and maintenance.
