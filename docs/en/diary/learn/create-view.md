# Create a group view

You can add a selection of users and resources in your organization to a view.

## Name and save this view

1. Click the **View** tab in the **Diary** screen.

1. Click the **Task** button (![icon][img1]) at the bottom right and choose **New group view**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To edit an existing view, click **Edit**, and to copy an existing view, click **Copy**.

    <details><summary>Why is the Edit button greyed out?</summary>
    You can change only group views created by you. In a predefined group view, the **Edit** button is greyed out to indicate that you cannot change it here. These group views contain all users assigned to the specific groups. This is defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

    To edit and save a predefined group view, select the **Copy** option and save the view with a new name.
    </details>

1. In the **New group view** dialog, enter the appropriate information in the **Name** and **Description** fields.

1. Choose to view the diary for **Associates**, **Project**, or **Resource** in the **Select from** field.

1. The contents of the list box immediately below the **Select from** field vary depending on what you selected under **Select from**.

    * If you selected **Associates**, a list of user groups in your organization is displayed. You can also select **All** to display all the users in the organization.

    * If you selected **Project**, the history list of projects is displayed.

    * If you selected **Resource**, a list of resource groups in your organization is displayed. This list is defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. Select **All** to see all the resources in your organization.

1. Select the users/resources you require and click the right arrow ( ![icon][img2] ) to add them to the pane on the right. You can also select users and resources individually by double-clicking them.

1. The pane on the right displays all the users and resources you added to the group view. To remove a user or a resource from this list, select it and click **Delete**.

1. The selected users and resources will be displayed in the group view in the same order as in the pane on the right. To change this order, select a user or resource and click arrow up ( ![icon][img3] ) or arrow down ( ![icon][img4] ) to move it up or down.

1. Click **Save** after selecting users and resources, or click **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving.

You will then be returned to the **View** tab, where you can create appointments for associates, and so forth.

> [!TIP]
> To delete the active group view, click the **Task** button at the bottom right and select **Delete group view**.
