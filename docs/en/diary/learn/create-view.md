# Create a group view

You can add a selection of users and resources in your organization to a view.

## Name and save this view

1. Click the **View** tab in the Diary screen.

1. Click the **Task** button (![icon][img1]) at the lower right and choose **New group view**.

    > [!TIP]
    > To edit an existing view, click **Edit**, and to copy an existing view, click **Copy**.

    <details><summary>Why is the Edit button greyed out?</summary>
    You can change only group views created by you. In a predefined group view, the **Edit** button is greyed out to indicate that you cannot change it here. These group views contain all users assigned to the specific groups. [!include[SM](../../learn/includes/are-defined-sm.md)]

    To edit and save a predefined group view, select the **Copy** option and save the view with a new name.
    </details>

1. In the **New group view** dialog, enter the appropriate information in the **Name** and **Description** fields.

1. Choose to view the diary for **Associates**, **Project**, or **Resource** in the **Select from** field.

1. The contents of the list box immediately below the **Select from** field vary depending on what you selected under **Select from**.

    * If you selected **Associates**, a list of user groups in your organization is displayed. You can also select **All** to display all the users in the organization.

    * If you selected **Project**, the history list of projects is displayed.

    * If you selected **Resource**, a list of resource groups in your organization is displayed. This list is defined in Settings and maintenance. Select **All** to see all the resources in your organization.

1. Select the users/resources you require and click the right arrow ( ![icon][img2] ) to add them to the pane on the right. You can also select users and resources individually by double-clicking them.

1. The pane on the right displays all the users and resources you added to the group view. To remove a user or a resource from this list, select it and click **Delete**.

1. The selected users and resources will be displayed in the group view in the same order as in the pane on the right. To change this order, select a user or resource and click arrow up ( ![icon][img3] ) or arrow down ( ![icon][img4] ) to move it up or down.

1. Click **Save** after selecting users and resources, or click **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving.

You will then be returned to the **View** tab, where you can create appointments for associates, and so forth.

> [!TIP]
> To delete the active group view, click the **Task** button at the lower right and select **Delete group view**.
