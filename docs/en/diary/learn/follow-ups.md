# Follow-ups

*Follow-up* is a collective term for [meetings](#meeting) and [to-dos](#todo). A [phone call](#call) is a hybrid of the two. These activities are closely linked to the Diary screen and function in largely the same way.

Open an existing follow-up by double-clicking it in the Diary or the **Activities** section tab.

## Create new

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a follow-up by clicking **+New** in the top bar and then select **Meeting/Appointment**, **To-do/Task**, or **Follow-up/Call**.

> [!NOTE]
> Follow-ups created from the Diary screen are by default meetings. However, you can change the type before you save.

## Locate your follow-ups

In in the Diary screen, meetings and phone calls appear on the **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **View** tabs - and in the **Day**, **Month**, **Next day**, and **Week** side panels.

The **Activities** section tab (in the Company, Contact, Sale, Project, and Diary screen) shows all follow-ups, including to-dos.

## Follow-up types

| Type | Start time | End time | Duration | Deadline | Shown in | Description | Example |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| Meeting (appointment) | &#10003; | &#10003; | Calculated | | Calendar | Activity w/ defined start and end time | External meeting with supplier |
| To-do (task) | | | | &#10003; | Activities section tab | Follow-up w/ no start time | reminder for stuff due by a specific time |
| Follow-up (call) | &#10003; | | &#10003; | | Activities section tab | Phone call | Incoming call from customer |

## <a id="meeting" />Meeting (appointment)

Meetings are activities with a defined start and end time. They are shown in the owner's calendar.

A meeting can be a single event or part of a recurring series. Meetings involving a resource and/or additional attendees are called [invitations][5].

Overdue and completed meetings will be in the **Activities** section tab in addition to in the calendar.

### Common scenarios

| Scenario | Resource | 2+ attendees | Description |
|---|:-:|:-:|---|
| Own time reserved | | | You have set aside time to work on something, alone |
| Own time and resource reserved | &#10003; | | As above plus need room or equipment |
| Meeting with multiple attendees | &#10003; | &#10003; | A meeting, commonly also with a resource or location |

## <a id="todo" />To-do (task)

A *to-do* is a follow-up without a start time. It usually does not have a duration either, but it always has a **deadline**. To-dos are typically used for things you have to remember to do by a certain time.

By default, you will find to-dos in the diary todo list, where they can be checked off when completed. If you specify a start and end time for a to-do, it is entered in the diary at the given day and time.

## <a id="call" />Follow-up (phone call)

A *call* represents a very specific action - the phone call - and is a hybrid between an meeting and a to-do:

* When you initially plan a call, it lives in the todo list with a deadline much like a to-do.
* When you make the call, it gets fixed in time and now resembles an meeting.
  * The start time becomes the current time and today's date.
  * The default duration is 15 minutes.

## Default duration

The default duration is 1 hour for a meeting and 15 minutes for a call. To change the default value:

1. Go to ![icon][img14] **Personal settings** and select **Preferences**.
1. Select **Default values**.
1. Enter a value for one or both of these values and click **Save**.
    * **Duration for new appointment**
    * **Duration of a new phone call**

## <a id="more-tab" />The More tab

The **More** tab displays user-defined fields for the follow-up. If your organization needs more fields than the default fields for follow-ups, you can specify in Settings and maintenance that these fields will be inserted here.
