# Show follow-ups you are invited to

When you view a follow-up you are not the owner of, the usual **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog is displayed. However, you cannot make changes to other people's invitations, nor add participants, so the **Add** button in the **Participants** tab is disabled.

**Note:**

* Until you [accept or decline the invitation][2], the dialog has two extra buttons: **Accept** and **Decline**. Once you accept, the button is disabled.

* Because you did not create the appointment, task or phone call yourself, you may change only the **Priority**, **Alarm**, and **Completed** fields. All other options are disabled.
