# Follow-ups you are invited to

Attendees who are invited to a follow-up will receive a notification.

![Receive invitations -screenshot][img2]

## <a id="accept"></a>Accept or decline invitation

* Click the bell icon in the Top bar to view your invitations.
* Click the link in the **Notifications** panel to open the follow-up.
* Click **Accept** or **Decline** to respond to the invitation.

    To see declined meetings that you might now be able to attend, choose **Show invitations I have declined** at the bottom of the **Notifications** panel.

### Note

* When you view a follow-up you are not the owner of, the **Follow-up** dialog has two extra buttons - **Accept** and **Decline** - until you respond to the invitation.

* If you first accept an invitation and then delete the follow-up from your diary, it is counted as though you declined it. The follow-up disappears from the diary and your name is marked with a red cross in the list of attendees.

* If you accept an invitation and subsequently open the **Follow-up** dialog, you cannot edit any information about the follow-up except for the **Priority**, **Completed**, and **Alarm** fields. Other changes can be made only by the person who sent the invitation. You cannot add attendee, so the **Add** button is disabled.

* If you assign a follow-up to another user (change owner), and the recipient declines it, the follow-up is re-assigned to you.

* If you close the **Notifications** panel without accepting or declining the invitation, the follow-up remains there and an eye icon (<i class="ph ph-eye" aria-hidden="true"></i>) is displayed next to your name in the list of attendees to show that you have seen it, but not made a decision.

* If you receive an invitation for a time when you are already occupied, an exclamation mark (<i class="ph ph-warning" aria-label="Warning icon"></i>) is displayed. This draws your attention to the conflict.
