# Follow-ups you are invited to

Participants who are invited to a follow-up will receive a notification.

![Receive invitations -screenshot][img2]

## <a id="accept" />Accept or decline invitation

* Click the bell icon in the Top bar to view your invitations.
* Click the link in the **Notifications** panel to open the follow-up.
* Click **Accept** or **Decline** to respond to the invitation.

[Read more about notifications.][1]

### Note

* When you view a follow-up you are not the owner of, the **Follow-up** dialog has two extra buttons - **Accept** and **Decline** - until you respond to the invitation.

* If you first accept an invitation and then delete the follow-up from your diary, it is counted as though you declined it. The follow-up disappears from the diary and your name is marked with a red cross ![icon][img4] in the list of participants.

* If you accept an invitation and subsequently open the **Follow-up** dialog, you cannot edit any information about the follow-up except for the **Priority**, **Completed**, and **Alarm** fields. Other changes can be made only by the person who sent the invitation. You cannot add participants, so the **Add** button in the **Participants** tab is disabled.

* If you assign a follow-up to another user (change owner), and the recipient declines it, the follow-up is re-assigned to you.

* If you close the **Notifications** panel without accepting or declining the invitation, the follow-up remains there and an eye icon ![icon][img7] is displayed next to your name in the list of participants to show that you have seen it, but not made a decision.

* If you receive an invitation for a time when you are already occupied, an exclamation mark ![icon][img6] is displayed. This draws your attention to the conflict.
