# Edit or delete invitation

If you edit or delete an invitation that you created and sent, the invitees will receive a message about this. If you delete an invitation that you own from your Diary, this record also disappears from the inviteesâ€™ diaries.

If one of the recipients of an invitation chooses to delete the record from their own diary, it is deleted from their diary only. The record will then appear in the **Invitations** dialog, so that it can be found and accepted later on.

> [!TIP]
> To open the **Invitations** dialog, click the **Notifications** button ( ![icon][img1] ) on the Top bar.
