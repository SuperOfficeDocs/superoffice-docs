# Edit or delete invitation

* If you edit or delete an invitation that you created and sent, the invitees will receive a message about this.

* If you delete an invitation that you own from your Diary, this record also disappears from the invitees' diaries.

* If you delete a follow-up you are invited to, the follow-up is removed from your diary only.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Edit repeating follow-ups][1]
* [Stop repeating follow-ups][2]
