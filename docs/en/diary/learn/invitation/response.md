# Handle responses to invitations

When you send an invitation, the recipient can either accept or decline it. If the recipient declines the invitation, you have two options, depending on the type of invitation in question.

> [!NOTE]
> If the person accepts the invitation, it disappears from the **Invitations** dialog and is recorded in SuperOffice CRM in the usual way.

## Assigned follow-ups

An assigned follow-up is one you have delegated to someone else. This works as follows:

1. Delegate a follow-up to someone else by using the **Owner** field in the **Details** tab in the [dialog for follow-ups][1], or by clicking the **Task** button and select **Assign to**.

2. When you have saved the follow-up, it appears in the **Invitations** dialog in SuperOffice CRM for the other person.

3. If the other person declines the invitation, it appears as declined in your own **Invitations** dialog.

4. You can now click the **Reassign** button to assign the follow-up to someone else.

5. The **Assign to** dialog appears, allowing you to select another person to delegate the task to.

6. The follow-up is now displayed with the status **Assigned** in the **Invitations** dialog.

## Other follow-ups

1. [Link participants to follow-ups][2] in the usual way.

2. When you have saved the follow-up, it appears in the **Invitations** dialog in SuperOffice CRM for the other person.

3. If the other person declines the invitation, it appears as declined in your own **Invitations** dialog.

4. You can now click the **Reschedule** button to find a new suitable time. The dialog for follow-ups appears and you can now set a new time. In practice, points 2 to 4 are repeated until you find a suitable time.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a lot of information on the list of invitations and only want to display responses from others, you can filter the list using the **Show responses** checkbox.
