# Handle responses to invitations

When you send an invitation, the recipient can either accept or decline it. If the recipient declines the invitation, you have two options, depending on the type of invitation in question.

## Assigned follow-ups

An assigned follow-up is one you have delegated to someone else. This works as follows:

1. Delegate a follow-up to someone else by using the **Owner** field in the **Details** tab in the [dialog for follow-ups][1], or by clicking the **Task** button and select **Assign to**.

2. When you save the follow-up, the other person [receives a notification][3].

3. If the other person declines the invitation, you get an **Invitation declined** notification. Click **Got it** to acknowledge.

4. You are now the owner. Optionally, repeat step 1 to re-assign the follow-up to someone else.

## Other follow-ups

1. [Add participants to the follow-up][2].

2. When you save the follow-up, the other person [receives a notification][3].

3. If the other person declines the invitation, you get an **Invitation declined** notification. Click **Got it** to acknowledge.

4. Optionally, find a new suitable time and reschedule the follow-up.
