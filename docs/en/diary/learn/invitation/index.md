# Invite your associates to a follow-up

To allocate time for a meeting with one or more associates, use the **View** tab in the **Diary** screen. Here you can open your associates' diaries to see when your colleagues are available for a meeting. In addition, you can select to view resources such as conference rooms, to see when they are free and set up a joint reservation for everyone from within your own diary.

Follow-ups with associates are set up by linking them as participants to the follow-up.

## <a id="status" />Status

The users you chose to link to a follow-up will be notified of this on their screens. If you open the follow-up's **Participants** tab, you will see a list of participants and resources linked to the follow-up. You can also see who accepted or declined the invitation and which resources have been booked, from the symbols next to the names:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon][img1] | Invitation is accepted. |
| ![icon][img2] | Invitation is declined. |
| ![icon][img3] | Invitation is seen but not answered. |
| unmarked | Invitation has not been seen. |

### Resources

When you link resources, the status is set to *accepted* because a resource cannot answer the invitation itself.

It is possible to double-book a resource. If a resource is not free at the time in question, **Conflict** is shown in the **Status** column. An exclamation mark is also displayed in the **Appointment** dialog. You should change the time of the follow-up. The **First available** field displays the first available meeting time.

### External contacts

The people you choose under **Company** in the **Invitation** dialog are not usually members of your organization. You can send the invitation to them via email using the **Email invitation** option. Invitation emails sent to external contacts will contain an iCal file (.ics) with the invitation data. When they respond to your invitation, the status will automatically be updated in SuperOffice.

The follow-up is shown on the **Activities** section tab for the company in question.
