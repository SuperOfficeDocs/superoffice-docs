# Invite your associates to a follow-up

Invitations are **created** when calling meetings or other arrangements between different members of a company. You invite several associates or resources to join. When they **accept** an invitation, the follow-up will be displayed on their diary.

To allocate time for a meeting with one or more associates, use the **View** tab in the Diary screen. Here you can open your associates' diaries to see when they are available for a meeting. In addition, you can select to view resources such as conference rooms, to see when those are free and set up a joint reservation for everyone from within your own diary.

Follow-ups with associates are set up by linking them as attendees to the follow-up.

When we save the meeting, an invitation is added to the person we invited and will be shown in the diary of the person on the appropriate date and time. **This only happens if the invited person also is an associate.** You may invite persons belonging to other contacts as well, these will not have a diary where the meeting is shown. Instead, the follow-up is shown in the activity archive of their contact.

> [!NOTE]
> Resources and non-user persons don't receive invitations â€“ the meeting is just created as a normal meeting for them.

## <a id="status" />Status

The users you chose to link to a follow-up will be notified of this on their screens. In the follow-up dialog, you will see a list of attendees and resources linked to the follow-up. You can also see who accepted or declined the invitation and which resources have been booked, from the symbols next to the names:

| Icon | Description |
|:-:|---|
| ![icon][img1] | Invitation is accepted. |
| ![icon][img2] | Invitation is declined. |
| ![icon][img3] | Invitation is seen but not answered. |
| unmarked | Invitation has not been seen. |

## Resources

When you link resources, the status is set to *accepted* because a resource cannot answer the invitation itself.

It is possible to double-book a resource. If a resource is busy at the time, **Conflict** is shown in the **Status** column. An exclamation mark is also displayed in the **Follow-up** dialog. You should change the time of the follow-up. The **First available** field displays the first available meeting time.

## Handle responses to invitations

When you send an invitation, the recipient can either accept or decline it.

* If the recipient declines the invitation, you get an **Invitation declined** notification. Click **Got it** to acknowledge. Optionally, find a new suitable time and reschedule the follow-up or re-assign the follow-up to someone else.

* If the person accepts the invitation, it is recorded in SuperOffice in the usual way.
