# Add link from Follow-up or Document dialog

When you are in the **Follow-up** dialog or the **Document** dialog, you can add links to relevant activities, projects, or sales. For example, if you are going to a meeting with a company you have previously communicated with, you can add links to documents and sales you have already created for this company.

## Add activities and sales

1. [Open or create a follow-up][2] or [document][1].
1. Open the **Links** tab and click **Add link**.
1. Select one of the available options.
1. Select a record from the list or start typing the name of a record to search. If you selected the **URL** option, enter the link manually.
1. Click **OK**. You are then returned to the **Links** tab in the dialog chosen in step 1, with the selected record shown in the list of links.

## Open linked activities

To view details of a linked document, follow-up, sale, or project, double-click it.

## Remove linked activities

To remove a link, click the red X on that row.
