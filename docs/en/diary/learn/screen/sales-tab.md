# The Sales section tab

![The Sales section tab (Diary) -screenshot][img4]

In addition to the [Activities section tab][1], the Diary also contains the **Sales** section tab, which shows essential information about sales.

The following data is displayed:

* The date of the next activity recorded for the sale (the oldest follow-up that has not yet been completed)

    > [!TIP]
    > To find out what this next follow-up is, double-click the sale to open the Sale screen. The follow-up can be viewed in the **Activities** section tab of the sale.

* The current stage of the sale

* The sale amount

* The name of the company the sale is linked to

* Any contact the sale is linked to

* The name of the sale

* The sale date (estimated, sold or lost)

* A [status icon for the sale][4], showing if it is sold ![icon][img1], lost ![icon][img2] or stalled ![icon][img3] (if there is no icon, the sale is "open")

Sales not marked as completed are shown in this list.

## The Sales secretary

The **Sales** section tab in the diary functions as a kind of "sales secretary" to help you keep an overview of your sales – the activities you are planning and those you have forgotten to do. In this way, the **Sales** section tab is a sales-oriented task list, which shows you the following:

* All uncompleted sales where the sale date is within the defined display range.

* All sales with planned activities for a specific number of days ahead.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The number of days ahead, based on the next activity date, is a preference. To change it, go to ![icon][img5] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** and select **Functions** > **Show days ahead**.

* All sales with overdue activities (end date is earlier than today). These sales are shown in red.

* [Stalled sales][4] where you have set a reopen date. The reopen date overwrites the date in the **Next activity** field and is displayed in the **Next activity** column on the **Sales** section tab.
