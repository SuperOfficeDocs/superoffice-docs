# The Activities section tab

![Activities section tab (Diary) -screenshot][img4]

The **Activities** section tab gives you an overview of activities and acts as a to-do list. It contains, among other things, [meetings and to-dos][2] that you have not yet completed and you can use it to temporarily store follow-ups that you have not yet allocated to a particular time or date.

The activities list does not change when you switch between the different tabs in the top section of the Diary screen.

## Columns

The activities list columns contain the following information:

* ![icon][img3] : The first column in the activities list specifies the **Completed** [status of an activity][1]. A tick in the checkbox ![icon][img2] means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.

    > [!TIP]
    > To change the **Completed** status of an activity simply click the box.

* The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity.

    [!include[Table showing icons for activities](../../../learn/includes/table-activity-icons.md)]

* The remainder of the columns in the activities list show other information about the activity. If not all the text in a field is visible, hold the mouse pointer over it to display it in a tooltip.

## View activities in the activities list

Use the checkboxes in the section tab footer to specify which activities to display.

> [!NOTE]
> To-dos are follow-ups that do not usually have a defined time or duration.

## Open activities in the activities list

Open an activity directly from the activities list by double-clicking it. If you double-click a document, the document itself opens.

## Move between activities in the activities list

Use the scroll arrows to scroll up and down in the activities list.

To view the details of several activities from the activities list, without having to open each individual activity:

1. Go to the side panel and select the **Preview** view.
2. Click an activity in the activities list. The side panel displays a preview of the selected activity.

## Preferences

After an activity is completed, it is removed from the activities list by the next day. By default, the **Activities** section tab displays to-dos that you have not completed as of today's date.

### Display future to-dos

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.
2. Select **Functions** and find the **Show days ahead** option.
3. Define how many days ahead you want completed activities to be visible for. For example, entering 7 here would display to-dos for the next week.

### Remove activity from list when completed

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.
2. Select **Visual effects**.
3. Update the **Remove completed activities** [preference][8].

### Highlight overdue activities

If an activity is highlighted in red type, this means that its provisional date was passed. To change this setting:

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.
2. Select **Functions**.
3. Update the **Mark overdue activities** option.
