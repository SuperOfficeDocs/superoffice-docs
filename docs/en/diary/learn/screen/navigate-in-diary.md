# Navigate in the Diary screen

There are different ways of navigating in the diary.

## Move between days, weeks, or months

* Click the word **Diary** in the Navigator and select a time period from the list that appears, or click **Today** or **This week** to move to the current day or week.

* Click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the Diary.

* (if open) click a day or week in the day, week or month view in the side panel.

* In the **Day** tab, **Week** tab and **Month** tab you can click **Today** or **This week** to move to the current day or week.

## Switch views

The diary consists of [four different tabs][1]: **Day** tab, **Week** tab, **Month** tab and **View** tab. Switching between these views is easy: simply click the tabs at the top of the **Diary** screen. The relevant day, week or month is displayed at the top of the page, depending on which tab you select.

> [!TIP]
> Click **Diary** in the navigator and click a month, week number or a day in the calendar to move directly to one of the tabs above.
