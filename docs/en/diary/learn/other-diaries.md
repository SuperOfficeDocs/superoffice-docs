# View another diary

You can switch to another user's or resource's diary to check their availability, schedule follow-ups, or manage their to-dos.

## Which diary am I in?

When viewing a diary, the owner is indicated in the upper-right corner of the calendar. You can also identify whether you are viewing your own diary, another user's diary, or a resource's diary based on the following visual cues:

* **Your own diary:** Displays your name with a light gray border and the <i class="ph ph-user" aria-label="User icon"></i> symbol in green.

* **Another user's diary:** Displays the user's name with a red border and the <i class="ph ph-user" aria-label="User icon"></i> symbol in blue.

* **A resource's diary:** Displays the resource's name with a blue border and the <i class="ph ph-chair" aria-label="Resource icon"></i> symbol.

These indicators make it easy to confirm whose diary you are currently managing or viewing.

## Change diary owner

1. Click your name in the upper-right corner of the Diary screen. A list of users, user groups, and resources connected to the system is displayed. This is called the *diary owner list*.

    > [!TIP]
    > Start typing to quickly find users by name or user ID.

1. Select a resource or user directly from the list, or click a user group (<i class="ph ph-caret-right" aria-label="Chevron"></i>) to view all users in that group.

1. The Diary updates to show the selected user's or resource's calendar and activities list. Their name is displayed in the upper-right corner.

    You can use all the standard tabs (Day, Week, Month, or View) and create follow-ups in their calendar by selecting time slots, provided you have the necessary access rights.

1. To return to your own diary, click your name from the diary owner list.
