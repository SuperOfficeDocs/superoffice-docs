# Static selections

A static selection contains only the members you added individually or by searching, in contrast to a [dynamic selection][1]. After you created a static selection and added members to it, it will always contain the same members until you either add or remove some. Use a static selection to maintain absolute control at all times of its members.

Work with static selection gives you the option to manually add an delete selections members, either one by one or through a search.
