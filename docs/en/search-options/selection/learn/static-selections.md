# Static selections

A static selection contains only the members you added individually or by searching, in contrast to a [dynamic selection][1]. Once you created a static selection and added members to it, it will always contain the same members until you either add or remove some. Use a static selection to maintain absolute control at all times of its members.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Create a static selection][2]
* [Add members to static selections][3]
* [Remove members from static selections][4]
