# Delete records permanently

To delete multiple records (contacts, companies, sales, projects, and so on), you can create a selection of these records and delete them in one operation.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is only available for users with administrator access. It is also a task you should think about carefully before performing, because it deletes all selected records permanently, both from the **Selection** screen and from the SuperOffice database.
