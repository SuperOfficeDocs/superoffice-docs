# Export selection

## Export to Excel

[!include[Start](../includes/steps-start-task.md)]

1. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and select **Export to Excel**.

1. Click **Yes** to confirm.

1. Click the exported file to open it in Excel.

## <a id="to-file"></a>Export to file

Using this task, you can create a text file containing information about the selection members for use outside of SuperOffice CRM. It can be used both for members that are companies (on the **Companies** tab) and members that are sales, projects, documents or follow-ups. The template you select in the **Use template** field determines what information is included, the order it is displayed in, and the separator character to use.

1. [!include[Start](../includes/steps-start-task.md)]

1. Click the **Task** button and select **Export to file**.

1. In the **Export to file** dialog in the **Use Template** field, specify the template to use for the file you are exporting. The template determines what is exported. If you do not want to use the default option, choose another template from the list box.

1. Click **Create** to set the export running.

1. When the export is finished, save or open the file.

> [!NOTE]
> The text file may appear somewhat untidy if you open it in Notepad. This is normal for files where the information is delimited using separators such as TABs or semi-colons.
