# Print labels

Label printing will come in handy, for example, when you have to send out letters to many recipients in one go and need to produce address labels to stick on all the envelopes.

[!include[Start](../includes/steps-start-task.md)]

1. Select the **Company/contact** tab.

2. Click the **Task** button and select **Print labels**.

3. In the **Choose label** dialog, select the label format you require and click **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this dialog you can also [add new label formats][2] as well as [edit][3] and [delete][4] existing ones.

4. Open the generated PDF and print it.
