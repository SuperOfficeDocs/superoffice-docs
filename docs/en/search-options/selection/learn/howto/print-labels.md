# Print labels

Label printing can be useful when you need to send letters to multiple recipients and want to quickly produce address labels to apply to all the envelopes.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from version 10.3.10, label printing uses the browser's print functionality instead of the PDF print option.

## Steps

1. [!include[Start](../includes/steps-start-task.md)]

1. Go to the **Company/contact** tab.

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **Print labels**.

1. Choose your preferred label layout. All layouts are configurable and accessible to all users in the company, allowing you to fine-tune them as needed.

1. Review the required settings and click **OK**. For example:

    * Scale: Actual size, default or 100%
    * Margins: None
    * Orientation: Portrait
    * Paper size: A4

1. Adjust your browser's print settings (such as scale, margins, orientation, and paper size) to ensure the addresses fit correctly within the label area without overlapping.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you use the browser print for other items, you may need to **realign the label settings each time** to ensure proper alignment.

1. Click **Print**.
