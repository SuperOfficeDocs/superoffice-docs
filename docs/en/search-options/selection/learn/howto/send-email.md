# Send email to multiple recipients

Suppose you are inviting people to a meeting and need to send them an agenda. You can send a single email to multiple recipients at once.

> [!TIP]
> To send the email only to specific contacts in the selection, select them in the Company/contact tab before continuing. The **Perform task on selected members only** option will be checked automatically.

## Steps

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **Send email**.

1. In the **Send email** dialog, specify where to place the recipients.

    * **To**: Primary recipients (those expected to reply).
    * **Cc**: People receiving a copy for information.
    * **Bcc**: People receiving a copy without visibility to others.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only contacts with valid email addresses who are not marked **No Mailings** will be included.

1. Click **OK** to confirm.

1. An email message with the selected recipients opens in your default email program. Enter your message and send it as usual.
