# Send email to several recipients simultaneously

Letâ€™s suppose you were inviting people to a meeting and needed to send them an agenda. It would then be useful if you could send a single email to several recipients in one go.

1. To perform the task on only some of the contacts in the selection, select them in the **Company/contact** tab. The **Perform task on selected members only** option is then checked automatically.

2. Click the **Task** button.

3. Choose the **Send email** task.

4. In the **Send email** dialog, specify where to place the recipients.

    * **To**: field for the primary recipients (the people you expect to reply to the message).
    * **Cc**: field for the people you want to have a copy of the message, mainly for information.
    * **Bcc**: field for other people you want to send a copy to. These recipients are not visible to the other recipients and they themselves cannot see who else received the message.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The recipients here are all contacts with valid email addresses and which are not marked **No Mailings**.

5. Click **OK** in the **Send email** dialog.

6. An email message addressed to the selected recipients is opened in your default email program. Enter your message and send in the usual way.
