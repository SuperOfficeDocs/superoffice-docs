# Create mailing

You can send a mailing to all contacts in a selection. The mailing can be an email, an email attachment (document) or an SMS.

1. Open the selection you want to use for the mailing.

2. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

3. Click one of the following options:

    * **Create email mailing**: Select this options to [send emails to all or parts of your customer base][1].

    * **Create SMS mailing**: Select this option to [send SMS messages][2] to all or parts of your customer base by mobile phone.

    * **Create document mailing**: Select this options to [create merged documents][3] (PDFs) to print and send by regular mail to all or parts of your customer base.

    > [!TIP]
    > These options are also available from the **Marketing** button in the navigator.

In SuperOffice CRM, the mailing is added to the **Mailings** section tab in the Selection screen to help you keep track of all mailings related to each selection.
