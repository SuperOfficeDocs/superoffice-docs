# Perform tasks using selections

Selection, either dynamic or static, is a good starting point to solve some of your work load. You can use the selections in different ways like mailing recipients, side-panel view and creating charts used in Dashboards. But you can also perform a lot of different tasks when working with selections, categorized by Mailing/Activities, Manage, Print/Export and Delete.

Depending on the archive you see, either Company/Contact or the other different types, you have different options in the Task menu. On a selection of contacts you can Generate follow-ups, on a project selection you can use the Bulk update to set the project as completed, or Export to Excel any archive you want.

One of the objects of defining selections is to perform different tasks for the members or some of the members of the selection. In addition, these tasks are available from the list of results in the Find screen.

The **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) contains tasks such as sending emails, mass-editing and exporting. Which tasks are displayed depends on what type of records the selection consists of (what is selected in the **Selection of** field) and which tab is active.

> Certain tasks described here are not available to all [user levels][8].

## Steps

1. Go to the required selection. For example, search for a selection from the **Selection** button in the navigator or [use the Find screen][1].

2. Select the tab containing the records you want to work with.

3. To perform the task on just some of the selection members, select them. Then click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select the **Perform task on selected members only** option.

4. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and select the task you want to perform. The selected task starts.

    The available tasks depend on what type of records is in the selected tab.
