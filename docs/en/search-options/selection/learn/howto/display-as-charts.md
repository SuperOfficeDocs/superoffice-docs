# Display selection as a chart

After creating a selection, you can visualize your data using charts for a clearer and more immediate understanding. The available chart types depend on the selection type—for example, only sales-related charts are available for sales selections. Charts from dynamic selections can also be used in [dashboards][1].

## Steps to open a chart

1. Open the selection you wish to visualize.

1. Go to the **Charts** tab.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-chart-bar" aria-label="Bar chart"></i> and select a chart type to display the data visually. The chart titles indicate what data will be shown.

1. (Optional) Click <i class="ph ph-pencil" aria-label="pencil icon"></i> above the chart to open the settings panel, where you can configure the chart further.

> [!NOTE]
> To see charts for **all SuperOffice data** (not just selections), select **Dashboard** in the Navigator.

## Explore the chart

* Click the data labels (legend) to hide or show specific values.

* Hover over chart sections to see detailed source data.

* Click a chart section to drill down into the data. Select a row to preview it.

* Click <i class="ph ph-arrow-clockwise" aria-label="Refresh"></i> to update the chart with the latest data.

* Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task"></i> on the tab above the chart and select **View in full screen** to open a detailed view of the chart, including data tables and export options (**PDF, PNG, SVG, CSV, and XLS**).

## Troubleshooting: No data available

If a chart displays a **No data available** message, it means your selection does not contain the necessary information. Try these solutions:

* Adjust the selection criteria.
* Choose a different chart type that aligns with your selection data.
