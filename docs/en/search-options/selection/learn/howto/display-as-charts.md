# Display selection as a chart

After you have created a selection you can display your results visually for a more instant understanding of the data.

In the **Charts** tab you can click a chart type to display the data in the active selection as a chart. The available chart types depend on the selection type (only sales-related charts are available for sale selections). Dynamic selections with charts can also be used in [dashboards][1].

## How to visualize a selection in a chart

1. Go to the Selection in the navigator menu and either open an existing or create a new selection. Then select the Charts tab in the top bar of your Selection screen.

1. You will now see all the charts that are available to you. Choose the chart you wish to use. The title of each chart will tell you what the chart will visualize for you.

### Explore the chart

* Click on a chart to drill down on the chart data.

* Place the mouse-pointer over chart sectors to view detailed source data.

* Click the data labels (legend) next to or under the chart to hide/show specific data in the charts. This can be useful for printing or saving the charts from the preview window.

* ![icon][img1]: Opens a preview of a chart. Here you can also see the data source table for the chart.

* ![icon][img2]: Refreshes the chart with updated data.

> [!NOTE]
> Go to **Dashboard** in the navigator to view charts of ALL SuperOffice data.

## Did you get a message saying there is no data available?

Some charts might tell you there is No data available. This means that your selection does not contain the information this chart is trying to show. Change the criteria of your selection or choose another chart type.
