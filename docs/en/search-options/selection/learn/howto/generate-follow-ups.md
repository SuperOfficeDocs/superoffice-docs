# Generate follow-ups

You can create a follow-up to appear, for example, on the activities list of all members of a selection. This is useful, for example, when launching a new product and reminding sales staff to invite customers to a product demonstration.

## Steps

1. Go to the required selection and select the **Company/contact** tab.

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **Generate follow-ups**.

1. In the The **Generate follow-ups** dialog:

    * Select a predefined follow-up type from the **Type** field.
    * Enter start date in the **Start** field.
    * Enter a title for the follow-up in the **Title** field.
    * (Optional) Add additional details in the **Agenda** field.

1. (Optional) In the **Project** field, choose a project to link the follow-up to.

1. In the **Priority** field, select the priority level for the follow-up.

1. (Optional) Check Completed if the follow-up should be marked as completed.

1. Check **Generate only one follow-up on each company** to create a single follow-up per company instead of one per contact. The first company member added to the selection is invited.

1. Under **Select the owner of these follow-ups**, choose who will receive the follow-ups:

    * **My activities list**: Adds all follow-ups to your own activities list.

    * **Company owner's (our contact's) activities list**: Distributes follow-ups to the assigned company contacts (requires permissions in Settings and maintenance).

    * **Other associate**: Assigns follow-ups to another associate from the list. The contacts available depend on your **user level**.

1. Click **Save** to generate the follow-ups.
