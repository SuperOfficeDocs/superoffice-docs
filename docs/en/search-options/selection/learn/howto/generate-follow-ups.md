# Generate follow-ups

You can create a follow-up to appear, for example, on the activities list of all members of a selection. This would be useful if, say, your company had just launched a new product and you wanted to remind all the sales staff to invite their customers to a product demonstration.

1. Follow the procedure described under [Perform tasks using selections][1] and select the **Company/contact** tab.

2. Click the **Task** button.

3. Choose the **Generate follow-ups** task.

4. In the The **Generate follow-ups** dialog, select a predefined follow-up type from the **Type** field.

5. Enter the date when the follow-up will start in the **Start** field.

6. Enter a description of the follow-up in the **Description** field.

7. Choose which project to link the follow-up to in the **Project** field. Do one of the following:

    * Click the arrow and select a project from the list.
    * Typing the whole or the beginning of the project name (see [The History list][2] and [FastSearcher][3]).

8. In the **Priority** field, specify the priority of the follow-up. Click the arrow to display a list with the default options of high, medium and low priority.

9. Check **Completed** if the follow-up should be set as completed.

    It will then not be included when using FastSearcher and in counters, but will still be shown in the History list.

10. Check **Generate only one follow-up on each company** if you do not want to create a follow-up for each contact in each company in the selection.

    For each company just a single follow-up will be created, for the first company member added to the selection.

11. Select the owner of these follow-ups:

    * **My activities list**: All follow-ups will end up in your own activities list.

    * **Company owner’s (our contact’s) activities list**: The follow-ups will be distributed to the activities lists of the people defined as *our contact* for each company.
        The user must have been assigned rights for this in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

    * **Other associate**: Choose the desired option from the list of current contacts.
        The contacts available depend on your **user level**.

12. Click the **Save** button.
