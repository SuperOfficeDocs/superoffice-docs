# Selection

In SuperOffice CRM, you can create selections of records/data that you work a lot with. If you also have a licence for the quote module, you can create selections of products as well.

> [!TIP]
> You can create charts from selections and also use selections to create mailings.

All the selections also contain an overview of companies and contacts linked to the records in the selection. For example, companies and contacts linked to the sales in a sale selection.

## Types

There are three different types of selections in SuperOffice CRM:

* [Static selection][7], which contain only the members you have added manually or via Find.
* [Dynamic selection][8], which will always be updated automatically with members that match the selection criteria.
* [Combined selection][9], which is a combination of two existing selections.

## Add record as a favorite

From the **Tasks** button (lower part of the screen), you can [perform specific tasks on the members of a selection][1]. For example, send an email to contacts linked to the sales in the selection.
