# Dynamic selections

A dynamic selection can be compared to a saved search that is executed each time you view the selection. Each time you add records to SuperOffice CRM containing data that fulfil the search criteria in a dynamic selection, the selection will be updated with the new member, unlike a [static selection][1]. Use a dynamic selection if you want an updated list of companies, contacts, sales, projects, documents, follow-ups, requests or products that meet a specific set of criteria.

## Examples of what you can use dynamic selections for

### Companies

You could create a dynamic selection containing all companies in the "Supplier" category located in Germany if you were planning further activities in Germany.

### Sale

You can create a selection containing all sales you have achieved in the first quarter, or all your sales with the **Stalled** status. This will enable you to spot trends and assess where to direct your future sales efforts.

### Projects

You could create a selection containing all projects of the type "Internal" which are current. This would allow you to assess which can be closed/completed, and which it is worth still working on.

### Documents

You can create a selection containing all documents you have created in the last month. This will give you an overview what documents have been produced and see any that you may have forgotten about.

### Follow-ups

You can create a selection containing all follow-ups for a specific customer, to get an idea of the sort of relationship you have with them before having a sales meeting with them.

And you can create a selection containing all follow-ups you have this month, to see what follow-up you have and if you should set up more.

### Products

You can create a selection containing all products sold this year, based on sales which contain quotes and have the status Sold. The selection can be limited to specific products categories, product families, and son on based on the type of statistical output you need.

If you are going to upgrade one of your products from, say, version 2 to version 3, you can create a selection of all customers who have purchased version 2, and use this as a basis for a campaign.

### Requests

You can create a selection containing all open request that have not been updated for over a week. You can then follow up on the request handlers responsible for these requests.
