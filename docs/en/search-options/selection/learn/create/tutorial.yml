    1. Click **New** on the Top bar and select **Selection**.

    1. In the Find screen, click the **Find** option that is relevant for the data type you want to use in your selection. You can also click **Typical searches** to use predefined searches.

    1. [Add your search criteria](../../../learn/search-criteria.md) in the **Criteria** tab.

    1. Click **Find**. The **Results** tab displays the data matching your criteria.

    1. To save the results in a selection, click **Save as selection**. If not, refine your search criteria.

    1. In the **Save as selection** dialog, choose type:

        * **Dynamic selection** - this type of selection will always be updated with members that match the selection criteria.
        * **Static selection** - this type of selection will contain only the members you have added manually.

    1. Click **Save**.

    1. Type the name of the new selection where *Selection name* appears. This field is mandatory.

        If you try to create a selection with the same name as an existing selection, the **Duplicates** dialog opens. This works in the same way as for companies. For details, see [Duplicates](../../../../learn/basics/duplicates.md).

    1. In the **Selection is** field, you can change to another type of selection if necessary.
