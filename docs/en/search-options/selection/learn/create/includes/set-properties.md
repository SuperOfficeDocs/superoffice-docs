1. The **Owner** field automatically displays the user currently logged in.

    After saving a new selection, you can change the owner by [editing the selection][1]. In practice, this means that you transfer it from yourself to someone else. To edit a selection, you must either be the owner or have administrator access, or you must have editing access via the **Functions** preference.

1. In the **Category** field, choose the type of selection you require. These options are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

1. In the **Visible for** field, choose if the selection should be visible to everyone, private (only visible to the person defined as owner) or visible to everyone in the user group that the owner belongs to.

1. Add a description of the selection in the **Description** field, if relevant.

1. Check **Completed** to specify that the selection is inactive. If you want the selection to be active, leave this box unchecked.
