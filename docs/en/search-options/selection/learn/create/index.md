# Create selections

You start off with a set of criteria from the **Find** screen by using a typical search or adding your own criteria. From there you can save the result as a dynamic or static selection. The difference between the two are a selection that keeps on updating the number of members (dynamic) or a selection that have the members frozen with a snapshot of today's set of members (static).

When you save your search to a selection, you have 3 options:

* Dynamic selection
* Static selection
* Add to existing static selection

## Steps

Static and dynamic selections are created in a similar way:

1. Find the data you want to included in the selection via the **Find** screen. Choose either static or dynamic as your type and save.
2. Set the properties.
3. Optionally add the new selection to your favorites. Then save.

Step 1 is different for combined selections because you start with two existing selections instead of looking for data.

> [!TIP]
> Click ![icon][img4] to the right of the column headers. Here you can group and filter records, and add/remove columns. These settings can be saved for the active selection by selecting **Save columns for current selection only**. See also [The section tabs][4] for additional functions.
