# Create a combined selection

## Find the data

1. Open one of the selections you want to combine.

1. Click the **Task** button and select **Combine selection with**. A new selection screen opens.

1. Type the name of the new selection in the field containing *Selection name* . This field is mandatory.

1. In the **Selection of** field, choose what the selection is to contain. The choices here are limited to **Company/contact** and the type of selection you have selected. You cannot change this after it is saved to the database.

1. In the **Selection is** field, **Combined** is selected by default.

1. Under **Selection 2**, choose the other selection you want to combine.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you selected **Companies/contacts** under **Selection of**, you can choose from all types of selection here (a sales selection also contains companies/contacts related to the sales). But if the combined selection comprises Sales, Projects, Documents, Follow-ups, Requests, Form submissions, Chat conversations, Mailings or Products, you must choose the same type of selections for **Selection 1** and **Selection 2**.

1. Under **Compare**, select which entries from the two selections to include in the combined selection.
    [!include[Options for combining selections](../includes/table-selection-combinations.md)]

## Choose details

Set properties following the instructions of step 2 in the [Create selection][1] tutorial.

## Finish

1. [!include[Add to Favorites](includes/add-to-fav.md)]

1. Click **Save**.

After saving the selection, you can [edit it](../update/index.md) to change both the combination type and which selections are combined. But it is not possible to change the **Selection of** field.
