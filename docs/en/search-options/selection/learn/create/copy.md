# Copy a selection

Selecting the **Copy the selection** task provides a quick and easy way of making an exact copy of a selection.

When you click this button, a copy of the selection is created, with the text (copy) next to the selection name. In other words, if you copy the selection named *My static selection*, the copy will be named *My static selection (copy)*.
