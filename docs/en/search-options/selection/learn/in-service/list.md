# List selections

At the top of the **List selections** screen are two buttons:

* **New selection**: Click here to create a new selection.
* **New folder**: Click here to create a new folder. This applies if you have arranged your selections into a folder structure.

## View existing selections

1. Select **Selections** > **List selections**. This takes you to the **List selections** screen, containing a list of all the selections you have access to. The number of records in each selection is given in parentheses. You can hover the mouse pointer over the name of a selection to display the selection type (for example, static or dynamic) and what type of records it contains.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you check **Show in left menu** when you create a selection, the name of the selection is also displayed under **Selections** in the Navigator.

2. Click the required selection. The selection is opened so that you can see which records it contains.

3. From the selection you can perform the same task on all or some of the records.

## Perform batch tasks on records in a selection

1. In the list, select as many records as you want.
2. Click the ![icon][img1] menu button in the lower left corner, and select **Batch management**.
3. Choose an action that you want to perform for all the records at once. Depending on the type of selection, you can, for example, add the same message to multiple requests, delete the selected records or merge records.
