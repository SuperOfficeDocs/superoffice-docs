# Administrate folders of selections

Under **Selections** > **List selections** you can create a folder structure for the selections, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the selections in any of these folders. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

1. Click **New folder** at the top of the screen.
2. In the **Folder** field, select a parent folder in the list.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
4. Click **OK**. The new folder is created.

## Edit folders

You can edit both the name of a folder and the details you entered when creating it.

1. Go to the required folder.
2. Click the name of the folder.
3. Amend the fields.
4. Click **OK**. The changes are saved.

## Delete folders

When you delete a folder, all its contents (selections, FAQ entries, reply templates, tables, scripts, macros, and so on) are also deleted from SuperOffice Service.

1. Go to the required folder.
2. Click the name of the folder.
3. Click **Delete**.
4. Click **OK** to confirm. The folder and its contents are removed from SuperOffice Service.
