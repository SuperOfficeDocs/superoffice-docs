# Create a selection based on search criteria

The simplest way to create a selection is to base it on a search. This creates a dynamic selection.

1. Open the search screen.
    * You can select **Requests** > **Find requests** to [search for requests][1].
    * You can [use predefined lists][2] to search for requests.
    * You can select **Customers** > **Find contacts** or **Find companies** to search for contacts and companies.
    * In the knowledge base, you can click the **Search** icon ![icon][img1] to the right of a folder name to search for different types of content.

2. [Enter or adjust the criteria][3].

3. Click ![icon][img2] > **Save as selection**. The **Edit selection** screen is displayed.

4. In the **General info** tab, enter the following:

    [!include[Contents of Selection General info tab](includes/selection-general-info.md)]

5. In the **Selection** tab you can view the [search criteria][3] specified for the selection. If necessary, adjust the criteria.

6. In the **Profile** tab, specify how the selection should be presented:

    [!include[Contents of Selection Profile tab](includes/selection-profile-tab.md)]

7. Click **OK**. The selection is saved, and you are returned to the **List selections** screen. From here you can, for example, update the selection.
