# Update a selection

When you update a selection, you can see how many members (records) it has at the present time.

## Update from the Navigator

If you checked **Show in left menu** when you created a selection, the name of the selection is also displayed under **Selections** in the Navigator. The number of entries in the selection is given in brackets and this number is updated when you click the selection name.

## Update a selection not displayed in the Navigator

1. Select **Selections** > **List selections**. This takes you to the **List selections** screen.
2. Point at the selection name, to make the icons appear to the right.
3. Click the ![icon][img1] **Update number of results** icon. The number in brackets next to the name is updated.

> [!TIP]
> When you edit a selection, you can update the selection by clicking the **Execute** button in the **Edit selection** screen.
