# Delete a selection or its records

You can delete the definition of the selection, the dataset it contains, or both.

Deleting a selection does not delete the actual records it contains. They will remain in the system, but will no longer be available as a collected dataset under **Selection**.

## Delete the selection definition

> [!NOTE]
> To delete a selection, you must have access to both read and edit the selection in question.

1. Select **Selections** > **List selections**. This takes you to the **List selections** screen.
2. Point at the selection name, to make the icons appear to the right.
3. Click the **Edit selection** icon ( ![icon][img1] ). This takes you to the **Edit selection** screen.
4. Click **Delete**.
5. When asked if you are sure you want to delete the selection, click **OK**.

## Delete actual records of a selection

> [!NOTE]
> This option is not available for all selections. It depends on the type of records you selected in the **Source table** field when you created the selection.

1. Select **Selections** > **List selections**. This takes you to the **List selections** screen.
2. Click the required selection. The selection is opened so that you can see which records it contains.
3. Select all the entries, or as many as you want.
4. Click the ![icon][img2] menu button in the lower left corner and select **Batch management**.
5. Select **Delete** from the list of displayed options.
6. Click **OK** in the screen which appears, to confirm that you want to delete that number of entries.
7. Optionally, delete the selection itself.
