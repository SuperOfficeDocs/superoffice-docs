# Use board view in selections <i class="ph ph-kanban" aria-hidden="true"></i>

Board view presents your [selection][2] in a column-based layout using cards. You can group and filter the selection members (records shown on the board), and use drag-and-drop to move cards between groups.

The functionality is the same across supported entities: you can drag cards, open task menus, and adjust board settings. The available grouping and filtering fields vary depending on whether you are working with sales, projects, or requests.

## Open board view

1. Go to a selection.
1. In the upper-right corner, select the **board view** icon (<i class="ph ph-kanban" aria-label="Kanban board"></i>).

## Work with cards

* Click the card title to open the full record (for example, a sale card).

* Hover over a name or company to preview contact details.

    ![Hover preview showing contact details on a card -screenshot][img3]

* Drag cards between columns to update the grouping field (such as stage or owner).
  * If subgroups are enabled, you can also drag cards between rows.

* To edit a card, point to it and select the **Edit** button (<i class="ph ph-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i>). This opens the same edit dialog used elsewhere in SuperOffice CRMâ€”without leaving the board view.

* For more options, point to the card to reveal the **Task** menu (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>), then select it and choose from the available actions.

  * **Sales:** Edit, Create follow-up, Mark as sold/lost, Delete
  * **Projects:** Edit, Create follow-up, Create document, Mark as completed, Delete
  * **Requests:** Edit, Close request, Delete

The total value appears **next to each column name**, helping you track value distribution across stages, owners, or other grouping fields.

## Use cases

Board view supports different roles and workflows. Here are examples for sales representatives, project members, support agents, and managers:

### Sales representatives

* **Visualize your open sales** and track where each opportunity is in the pipeline.
* **Drag a card to another column** to update the sale stage.
* **Filter by sale date** to focus on what needs attention now.
* **Open the task menu** to create a follow-up, or mark a sale as sold or lost.
* **Quickly edit a card** to update details, such as a new contact person.

### Sales managers

* **Visualize the entire pipeline** and understand the distribution of sales across stages.
* **Summarize by amount** to support forecasting.
* **Filter by sale type** to focus on new business or specific campaign types.
* **Group by owner** to check workload per sales rep and rebalance using drag and drop.
* **Use stage as group and sale type as subgroup** to get a strategic overview by category and phase.

### Project members

* **Visualize your active projects** and track progress through different statuses.
* **Drag a card to another column** to update the project status.
* **Filter by next milestone or end date** to focus on urgent deliverables.
* **Group by responsible** to see ownership of projects across the team.
* **Open the task menu** to create a follow-up or document, or to mark the project as completed.

### Project managers

* **Get a full overview of all projects** to monitor status and identify delays.
* **Summarize by type** to compare customer projects, internal initiatives, or development work.
* **Filter by responsible** to balance workload among team members.
* **Group by status** to see how projects move through phases, or by type to align with business priorities.

### Support agents

* **Visualize your assigned requests** and track them across statuses such as new, in progress, and closed.
* **Drag a card to another column** to update the request status.
* **Filter by deadline or priority** to work on urgent cases first.
* **Group by status** to follow progress, or by request type to focus on specific categories.
* **Open the task menu** to close the request.

### Support managers

* **Get a full overview of incoming requests** and see distribution by status.
* **Summarize by priority** to ensure high-importance requests are handled quickly.
* **Filter by category or created date** to analyze trends in customer issues.
* **Group by owner** to monitor workload across agents and reassign requests as needed.
* **Use status as group and priority as subgroup** to get a structured overview for analysis and reporting.

Use grouping creatively to organize and act on data efficiently.

## Troubleshooting and tips

* **New sales are missing:** Click <i class="ph ph-arrow-clockwise" aria-label="Refresh icon"></i> to reload the board view and fetch the latest data.

* **Filter toolbar not visible:** Toggle the filter toolbar on or off using the <i class="ph ph-sliders-horizontal" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon.

* **A column is empty:** You may have filtered out its contents. Check the active filters in the toolbar.

* **Cannot find a filter field:** Open **Settings** (<i class="ph ph-gear-six" aria-hidden="true"></i>) > **Filter toolbar** and enable the field you want to use.

* **Need to edit the selection itself (not a card)?** Click <i class="ph ph-subtract-square" aria-label="Selection icon"></i> to return to selection view. Edit and task buttons for the selection are not available in board view.

* **Search the board by name:** Use the **Filter by title** field at the top to narrow down visible cards by name.

* **Save layout per use case:** Select **Save settings for current selection only** if you want to preserve a specific board layout, filters, or grouping for one selection only.
