A dynamic selection can be compared to a saved search that is executed each time you view the selection. Each time you add a record that fulfils the search criteria in a dynamic selection, the selection will be updated with the new record, unlike a static selection. You could, for example, [create a dynamic selection][1] containing all requests belonging to a specific category and which have a high priority.
