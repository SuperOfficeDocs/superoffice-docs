# Copy into selections

It may useful to copy specific selection members into another selection, for example, if you have created a selection of customers and want to include suppliers in the same selection.

[!include[Start](../includes/steps-start-task.md)]

1. Click the **Task** button and select **Copy into selection** task.

1. In the **Copy into Selection** dialog, select one of the following:

    * **Copy into existing static selection**: select this option to copy the active selection into an existing static selection. In this case, specify the required selection.

    * **Copy into new selection**: select this option to [create a completely new selection][2] containing the members of the active selection. In this case, you must also specify a name for the new selection, what type of selection it is and for whom it is visible.

1. Click **OK**. The selection is copied to the specified destination.

## Why can't I see all my selections?

You cannot copy a selection to an existing dynamic selection or combined selection. So you will only have the option of selecting from existing static selections.

## Why can't I opt to make the new selection dynamic?

Since a dynamic selection does not contain any physical contacts, but just a set of search criteria, it is only when you copy a dynamic selection that you can choose between **Static** and **Dynamic** in the **Selection is** list box. If you copy a static selection, the **Selection is** list box will only contain the **Static** option.

To create a copy of a dynamic selection, you can use the **Copy the selection** function on the **Task** tab.
