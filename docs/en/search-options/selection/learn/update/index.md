# Edit selections

> [!NOTE]
> To edit a selection, you must own it or have administrator access.
>
> You cannot edit the **Selection of** field.
>
> You can turn a dynamic selection or a combined selection into a static selection, but you cannot turn a static selection into a dynamic selection or a combined selection.

## Edit an existing selection

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD029 -->
[!include[Open Selections](../includes/goto-selections.md)]
<!-- List starts in the include. Next line MUST be 2. -->
2. Go to the required selection. You can, for example, [search][1].

3. Open the **Details** tab.

4. Click **Edit**. The **Selection** tab changes to edit mode.

5. In the **Selection** is list, you can change a dynamic or combined selection into a static selection.

6. When you have made the required changes, click **Save** to close and save the changes. Click **Cancel** to reject your changes.

## Why can't I convert the selection into a dynamic one?

After adding members to a selection, the following applies:

* You cannot change a static selection into a dynamic one, because the static selection does not contain any search criteria.

* You can, however, turn a dynamic selection into a static one. The search result is then saved into a fixed, static selection that is not updated even if you subsequently add more companies that match the search criteria you specified for the dynamic selection.

* You can turn a combined selection into a static one. The search result is then saved as a fixed, static selection.

## What do you want to do?

* [Add and remove members in a static selection][2]
