# FastSearcher

You can use FastSearcher in various ways:

* You can search directly from the Navigator to access the required company, contact, sales, project or selection.
* You can search for companies, contacts, sales, projects and selections from within dialogs containing the relevant fields, for example, the **Appointment** and **Document** dialogs, to link them to the appointment or document.
* You can search directly in the time zone selector to find the time zone for the required city or country.

## Using FastSearcher in the Navigator

1. Click the word **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale**, **Project** or **Selection** in the Navigator on the left of the window. An empty field is displayed at the top. Below this is a [list of records you have previously worked with][1].

> [!TIP]
> If you type a percent sign (%) in front of the search text, all records which *contain* the search text are displayed. For example, if you type %joh, both "Johnson Plumbing" and "Peter Johnson" are shown.

## Using FastSearcher in the time zone selector

1. Put the mouse pointer in the country field.

2. Enter the name of the city or country you want to find out the time zone for.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Names of regions in the time zone selector will always be in English, while country names depend on the language settings in SuperOffice CRM. Do not forget this when searching for countries and regions.

3. After you have found the required city or country, click the item to enable the required time zone.
