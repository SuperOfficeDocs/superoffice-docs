# Search options

Searching for information in your CRM database is something you do every day. Whether you're looking for a phone number or a list of all of your open sales, the Find feature will help you locate the information faster.

The following how-to guides will:

* Show you the different ways you can find information in SuperOffice CRM database.
* Explain how you can save your searches as a selection.
* Demonstrate what tasks you can perform using your search or selections.

With SuperOffice Find you can search for a single piece of data, such as a phone number, or a list of data, such as a list of mailing recipients.

SuperOffice CRM contains several different search tools:

* [FastSearcher][3]
* [The Find button][1]
* [Free-text search field][2]

## What can I search for?

* Companies
* Contacts
* Selections
* Follow-ups
* Sales
* Projects
* Documents
* Products
* Requests
* Chat conversations
* Form submissions
* Mailings

## Using FastSearcher

You can use [FastSearcher][3] or the [history list][5] to search for companies, sales, projects, and selections.

**FastSearcher** can be found either in the **Navigator** menu by pressing on the company, contact, sales, project or selection to open a search field, or within pop-up dialogs to search for companies, contacts, sales, projects and selections.

It will quickly make you a list that match your search words. Use it to check your database for possible duplicates before adding a new company or contact.

### FastSearch tips

You can use %% to see all records of a certain type, such as all companies, all selections, all projects.

If, for example, you want to see all the document templates available in SuperOffice CRM, go to the **+New** menu and click **Document**. In the top field in the document screen, which indicates types of document templates, type %%. You will then see a drop-down list that includes the full list of document templates available.

## Using the Find button

If you click the **Find** button on the top bar, you open the [Find screen][1], where you can search for data in SuperOffice.

The Find button helps you find records based on any criteria from companies, contacts, projects, selections, sales, products, follow-ups, documents and requests.

When you use the Find feature, you can save each search you perform as a selection.

## Using free-text search

Use the [free-text search][2] search field in the upper-right corner to search for any text that users have entered into SuperOffice CRM.

> [!TIP]
> Want to see a list of all your contacts? Click on the **Selections** icon in the left-side navigator panel and search for "All Contacts" to see a pre-configured selection.

## Using wild cards

Use **%** as a wild card when searching. The percent character (%) matches any string of 0 or more characters. For example: J%son matches Jackson, Johnson, Jason, and Json.

## <a id="typical" />Use typical searches as a starting point

A typical search is a pre-defined search that we have set up for you, so you can see what other users typically search for. Each data set in the Find screen contains a list of typical searches that are ready to be used.

A typical search is a great way to start looking for data in SuperOffice CRM. You can find typical searches by clicking below the group of data you are interested in. Containing pre-set search criteria, typical searches can be used as they are, modified or expanded.

### Example: My overdue follow-ups

This search will give you a list of all the activities that you have not completed yet. When you set up the criteria for this search, you can decide which type of activities you want to search for.

![Click the Find button in the top bar and select typical searches in the drop-down menu -screenshot][img5]

Typical searches are there to help you get started and create your own search of CRM data. After you have selected a typical search, you can add and edit the search criteria. And after you have created a useful search that you'd like to use again, you can save it as a selection.

## <a id="search-to-selection" />Create a search and save it as a selection

A selection is a list of data that shares one or more search criteria. It can be later used to perform a number of actions. In this guide we will explain how you can create a search and save it as a selection.

A selection is a great tool to extract useful information from your CRM database. It helps you find information based on criteria you choose and places the information in a list for further action.

For example, as a sales manager, you may want to see a list of all sales over €5,000 that are ready to be closed each month. Or maybe you are a consultant and want a list of all the projects you are involved in. Or, you work in marketing and need a list of all customers that have signed up for your monthly newsletter.

Creating a selection starts by performing a search. You can use a typical search and/or build your own search by adding the search criteria you need. After you have found the information you were looking for, you can save your search results as a selection.

There are three ways to save you search results as selection:

* **Create a static selection:** A static selection is a list of records that will not change until you add or delete content from this list manually. This means you have full control over your selection.

* **Create a dynamic selection:** A dynamic selection is a list of records that is always up to date. Any entry in your database that matches your selection criteria is automatically added to your selection.

* **Add to existing static selection:** You can add all the records you found in your search to an existing static selection, instead of creating a new selection.

Watch this video or follow the steps below to learn how you can create a search and save it as a dynamic selection (video length - 1:26):
