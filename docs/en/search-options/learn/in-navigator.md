# Using FastSearcher in the Navigator

1. Click the word **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale**, **Project**, **Request**, or **Selection** in the Navigator on the left of the window. An empty field is displayed at the top. Below this is a [list of records you have previously worked with][1].

2. In the box, enter the name of the record to search for. While you type, the list below displays all matching records.

3. Click the required record to open it.

## How it works

The Navigator FastSearcher runs two parallel searches:

* A standard *begins-with* search with optional wildcard (%). In a phrase, the longest word is looked up first.

* An *exact-match* *sounds-like* ([SoundEx][2]) search. If the phrase contains short words, multiple words are needed before look-up starts. The result is shown only if the standard search has 0 matches.

## Examples

* You can search for a sale by entering the name of the sale or the name of a company linked to the sale, in the FastSearcher field for **Sales** in the Navigator.

* You can search for a contact in the FastSearcher field for **Companies** in the Navigator.
