## Examples of searches

* Searching for "office" will also return SuperOffice.
* If you misspell a word, you will get suggestions. A search for "ofice" (misspelled) will also return "SuperOffice". This is also very useful when you remember parts of the company or contact you are searching for.
* Searching for "123" will also return "SAP 123", since numbers are also indexed.
* Searching for "IBM" will also return "I.B.M.", since the indexer also removes quotes, full stops and similar characters in the index.
