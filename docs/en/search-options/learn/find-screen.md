# The Find screen <i class="ph ph-list-magnifying-glass" aria-label="Find icon"></i>

To search for records and data in SuperOffice CRM, use the **Find** screen.

There are effectively no limits to what you can search for in SuperOffice CRM. At the end of this section, we have included examples to provide you with tips on searching.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a licence for Developer Tools, you can search for products in existing quotes. If you have a licence for SuperOffice Service, you can search for requests.

## Search for information in SuperOffice CRM

1. Click the **Find** button (<i class="ph ph-list-magnifying-glass" aria-hidden="true"></i>) on the [top bar][1].

1. Click the type of record you want to search for, or click **Typical searches** to display a list of predefined searches. The **Criteria** tab opens.

1. The **Find** screen contains predefined search criteria, or the search criteria you used last time. Do one of the following:

    * Click <i class="ph ph-x-circle" aria-label="X"></i> to remove any criteria you do not want to use.
    * Click the **Add** button to add new search criteria. A new line is added to the criteria list.

1. In the first list box on the line, select the field you want to search for information in. You can also [enter the start of the name in the appropriate field][2]. There are [different types of fields][3].

    For example, select **Contact** and **Last name** to search for contacts, or **Project** and **Event date** to search for projects.

1. Select values for the search criteria in the next fields on the line.

1. You can click **Add** below the criteria list again to specify more search criteria. A new line is added to the criteria list and you can repeat steps 4 and 5.

1. To move criteria, click and drag <i class="ph ph-equals" aria-label="="></i>.

1. Click **Or** to add a another set of criteria.

1. When you have specified and activated the search criteria you want, click the **Find** button. The **Results** tab opens with the results matching the search criteria.

> [!TIP]
> If, for example, you want to search for all companies, you can use the percent sign (%) when [entering search criteria][3] for **Company**.

## <a id="or"></a>Broaden your search using the OR function

The Find feature allows you to perform a search by combining search criteria with the value operator "OR" between them. This way you can search for two sets of independent data and save it in one selection.

Let us take a look at some practical examples of how you can use the OR function. You can search for all customers who bought "Product A" and customers who did not buy "Product B" to boost your cross-sales. Or you can search for all large customers based in Liverpool or Manchester, so you can contact them about an upcoming event in one of these cities.

## <a id="results"></a>Work with search results

After following the above steps, and search results are displayed in the **Results** tab, you have several options available:

* **Open the record:** To open one of the records, double-click it. For example, double-clicking a contact displays the **Contacts** section tab with that contact highlighted.

* **Display a record in the side panel:** Use the [side panel][4] to quickly browse through the search results. If you have searched for contact, select **Contacts** in the list at the top of the side panel. You can then click on each contact in the **Results** tab to preview them.

* **Perform tasks on the search results:** The **Task** button contains tasks such as:

  * Send a mailing and create activities
  * Manage the information in your selection
  * Print out or export your data
  * Delete the information in your selection from your CRM database
