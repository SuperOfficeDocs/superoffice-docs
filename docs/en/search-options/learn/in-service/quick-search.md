# Use quick search

No matter where you are in SuperOffice Service, the quick search field is always at the top right. You can use this field to quickly find data in the system. Quick search works slightly differently for requests and other records.

## Search for requests

1. Enter the ID of the request or part of the title in the quick search field.
2. Press **ENTER**.
3. One of the following happens:
    * If there is just one request that matches the search criteria, that request is opened.
    * If several requests match the search criteria, a list of search results is displayed. From this list, you can open the request you want.

## Search for requests using tags

1. Enter **\#** in the quick search field.
2. Press **ENTER** to show a list of all available tags, or start typing to search for tags.
3. Click a tag in the list. The tag is inserted in the quick search field.
4. Press **ENTER** to search. All requests with the selected tag, are displayed.

> [!TIP]
> Add multiple tags to narrow down your search even more. Repeat steps 1-4 to add additional tags. The search will return requests matching ALL selected tags.

## Search for other records

To search for things other than requests, start the search criteria by specifying what you are searching for using keywords:

* o = company
* c = contact
* k = knowledge base
* r = request (when searching for a title, not an ID)
* a = category
* e = owner
* p = phone

> [!TIP]
> Information on the use of keywords is displayed if you click the magnifying glass next to the quick search field ( ![icon][img1] ).

How this works in practice:

1. Enter the search criterion in this format.

    For example, to search for a company named "Autovalets", you could enter "o:autovalets" or "o:auto".

2. Press **ENTER**.

3. One of the following happens:
    * If there is just one record that matches the search criterion, that record is opened.
    * If several records match the search criterion, a list of search results is displayed. From this list, you can open the record you want.

> [!TIP]
> If you enter a search criterion containing the @ sign, the system assumes you have entered an email address and searches for people with this address. You can also search using a wildcard: enter "%%" for an unknown character.
