# Manage folders

Organize reply templates, FAQ entries, email addresses, and external documents in a logical folder structure within the knowledge base to make it easier to find information. You can create sub-folders at any level.

## Create folders

To create a new folder:

1. Go to the parent folder where you want to create a subfolder.
1. Click **New folder** at the top of the screen.
1. Confirm the parent folder in the **Folder** field or select a different one.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
1. Optionally, add a brief explanation in the **Description** field.

1. Extra steps for **FAQ folders**:

    * In the **Position** field, select a number for the entry's position in the sort order of the folder it belongs in. 1 means the top of the list.
    * In the **Access** field, select who is to have access to the folder in question. A registered customer is a customer who has access to a customer centre.
    * In the **Access control** field, optionally enter a script to use to control external customers' access to this folder. If this field contains a script, it is evaluated and access granted only if the script returns a value of "1".

1. Extra steps for **external documents**:

    * In the **Access** list box, select who is to have access to read and edit the folder.

1. Click **OK** to create the folder.

You are now ready to add knowledge-base items to the new folder. Either add new items, or change the **Folder** field on existing items.

## Delete folders

**Before you delete a folder, remove all contained items** by either:

* Deleting the items.
* Moving the items to another folder (change the **Folder** field on each item's edit screen).

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a folder with **external documents** also deletes all files within it immediately; you do not need to empty it first.

When you are ready to delete the folder itself:

1. Go to the required folder.
1. Click the **Edit folder** button.
1. Click **Delete**. The folder is deleted immediately.
