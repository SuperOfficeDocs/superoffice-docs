1. Go to <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **FAQ**.
1. Click on the required entry.
1. In the **FAQ entry** screen, click **Edit entry**.
1. In the **FAQ entry properties** screen, select the **Question** and **Answer** tabs, and read through the question and answer.
1. If required, edit the question and answer to make them suitable for an FAQ entry and reusable.
1. If you have [multiple languages][4], you have to select the different **languages** in the footer and check the question and answer tabs.
1. Select the **Properties** tab.
1. Publish the FAQ entry by selecting **Published** in the **Workflow** field.
1. Make any other required changes in the **Properties** tab.
1. Click **OK**. The FAQ entry is now available for use.
