# Work with email addresses

You can create a list of email addresses that you often use, but which are not registered for users or contacts in SuperOffice Service. For example, suppliers, partners, or product specialists. These addresses are accessible in most places where you send emails, such as in the **New request** and **Add message** screens.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires the Service-Premium user plan.

## List email addresses

If you want details of the registered email addresses, go to <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **Email addresses**. This takes you to the **Email addresses** screen, which contains email addresses in a folder structure that you can create yourself.

* To **search for** an email address, click the **Search** button.

## Create email address

1. The **Folder** field automatically shows the name of the folder you chose. If you change your mind, you can click <i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Chevron"></i> and select a different folder in the list that appears.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the person the email address belongs to.

1. In the **Email address** field, enter the person's email address.

1. In the **Mobile phone number** field, you can enter their mobile number. This can be used to send messages by SMS. (ONLINE only)
