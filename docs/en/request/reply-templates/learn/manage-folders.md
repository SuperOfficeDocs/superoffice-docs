# Folder management for reply templates

You can organize reply templates in a folder structure you create yourself, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate reply templates in each of these folders. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

[!include[How to create a folder](../../../learn/includes/howto-create-folder-kb.md)]

You are now ready to [add reply templates][1] to the new folder.

## Delete folders

Before you delete a reply template folder, you must remove all the entries in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* You can [delete the reply templates][2].
* You can move a reply template to another folder by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you [edit a reply template][3].
