# Search for reply templates

If there are lots of reply templates in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea.

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Main menu** in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **Reply templates**.
1. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
1. Enter the text you want to search for and optionally other criteria.
1. Click **Search**.
1. When the search finishes, a list of all the records containing the text you entered in the **Search string** field is displayed. You can open a record by clicking it.

> [!TIP]
> Perhaps you should consider to [create a folder structure][1] to make it easier to locate relevant reply templates?
