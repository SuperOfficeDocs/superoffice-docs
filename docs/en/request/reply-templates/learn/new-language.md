# Create new language version of reply template

It may be appropriate to have the same reply template in several languages, for example, if you need to send the same reply to customers in several countries.

## Add languages to reply template

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Reply templates**.

2. Go to the folder where the reply template is located.

3. Click the reply template. This takes you to the **View reply templates** screen.

4. Click **Edit reply template**. This takes you to the **Reply template properties** screen.

5. Click the **New language body** button at the bottom of the screen. A new tab is added, named **(Unspecified language)**.

6. **Language**: In this list, select the language for the current language body of the reply template. The list box contains the languages registered under ![icon][img1] **System settings** > **Customer languages**.

7. Enter the texts in the relevant language in the other tabs and make the necessary changes in this language version of the reply template. Find out more about this in [Create reply templates][1].

8. Click **OK**. The changes are saved. The **(Unspecified language)** tab changes to the selected language.

> [!TIP]
> Click the **Delete selected language body** to delete the active language body (the selected language tab).
