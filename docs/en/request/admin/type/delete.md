# Delete request type

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot delete the current default type (the one with a check mark in the **Use as default** box).

## Pre-requisites

* If the type you wish to delete is used as default, set another request type as default. (Until you do, the **Delete** button is deactivated.)

* Update any [email filters][1] and [Service mailboxes][2] that use this request type first. You cannot delete a type that is in use.

  * **Settings and maintenance** > **Requests** > **E-mail** > **Set properties** tab
  * **Settings and maintenance** > **Requests** > **E-mail** > **E-mail boxes** tab

## Steps

1. Click the **Requests** button in the navigator and select the **Request types** tab.

1. Click the required request type.

1. Click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the screen.

1. If there are any requests of this type, choose a new type from the **Transfer request type to** list.

1. Click **OK** to confirm. The request type is deleted all the requests are moved to the specified alternative type.
