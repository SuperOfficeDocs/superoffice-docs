# Work with external categories

In many cases it is not relevant or possible to use the internal category names in SuperOffice Customer Centre. The solution is to create external categories that are shown for customers. An external category is a category defined for a [specific customer language][1]. This means it is available if you register a new request via SuperOffice Customer Centre for this language.

Example: The internal category "Support" can then have an external category for all relevant customer languages.

## Create external categories

1. Go to Settings and maintenance and select <i class="ph ph-sliders-horizontal" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Options**.

2. Select the **Customer languages** tab.

3. Click the required language.

4. In the **Customer language** screen, click the **New external category** button.

5. In the **Edit external category** screen, click the **Category** field, and select the internal category name (the name visible to SuperOffice users).

6. In the **External name** field, enter the name which the category should have when displayed to your customers in this language in SuperOffice Customer Centre. In this way, you can use an internal name standardized in one language, while you can create an external "alias" in another language.

7. Optionally, click **Sub-element of** and select the name of any parent category to create a hierarchy of categories in the language in question.

8. Click **OK**. The external category is created, and displayed under **External categories** in the **Customer language** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> The external categories are displayed only in the **Customer language** screen.

## Delete external categories

1. In the **Customer languages** tab, select the language you wish to update categories for.
1. Select the required category name under **External categories**.
1. At the bottom of the **Edit external category** screen, click the **Delete** button.

    * The link to the external category from this customer language is deleted, but not the category itself.
