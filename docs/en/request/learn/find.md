# Find a request

Do one of the following:

* Use lists, which are actually predefined searches.
* Use the search screen for requests.
* Use the [quick search][3] in the top right corner.

> [!TIP]
> Learn about [search in SuperOffice][4] in general.

## <a id="list" />Use lists

The simplest way to search for requests is to use the search bar available as menu options under **Find request** on the Requests screen:

* **Last requests**: Shows the requests most recently recorded in the system. If specified in user preferences, this list will only contain requests from the categories you are a member of.

    <details><summary>How?</summary>
    To specify that only requests from categories you are a member of are displayed:

    1. Select ![icon][img2] **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.
    1. Set **Show only own categories** to Yes.
    1. Click **Save**.
    </details>

* **Own open requests**: Shows requests that belong to you and which have the **Open** status. This list contains the requests that you are responsible for, and is therefore the screen you will be working in most often.

* **Unassigned requests**: Lists requests that no-one is assigned responsibility for. To [take responsibility for one of the requests][6], it is important you do so by clicking **Accept request**. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time.

* **My favourites**: Shows the requests you have saved as favourites.

* **Get next in queue**: If the queue system is set up for your company, you can click this option to get the next unassigned request in the queue for the category you belong to. [How to set up Get next request in queue][5].

### Customise search criteria

In practice, all these lists are predefined searches, and if you wish you can customise the search criteria:

1. Click **Find request** in the header of the Requests screen.
1. [Adjust the criteria][4].
1. Click **Find** in the bottom right corner to begin the search using the new search criteria. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the preview screen on the right. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the [preview section](#preview).

> [!TIP]
> To restore the default settings, click the **Reset to default** button. You can also clear all your criteria by clicking the **Clear all** button.

### <a id="result" />Result

Contains a list of requests that match the criteria specified above. Here you can:

* Sort the requests by clicking the appropriate column heading.
* Select a row to display the content of that request in the preview section.
* [Open a request][3] by double-clicking the relevant row.
* Click the ![icon][img1] menu button in the top right corner to access the change the view options.

> [!TIP]
> The status **Open** together with the **Read** column will give an overview if the request were **Read by owner**, **New information** or **Not read by owner**.

Under the list, you can click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button to access the following options:

* **Export to Excel**: Click here to export the list under **Result** to an Excel file.

* **Bulk update**: If you select one or more requests in the list, you can click this option and select an action to perform on all the selected requests simultaneously. For example, you can choose to [add the same message to multiple requests][4], [forward multiple requests][5] or delete several requests in a single operation.

### Preview

This section of the screen displays the contents of the request selected under **Result**. You have the same options as when [processing requests][6].

If the preview section is not visible, click **Show preview** at the bottom of the screen.
