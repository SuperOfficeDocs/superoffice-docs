# Find a request

As a customer support agent, you get a lot of incoming calls and emails about pending or old customer inquiries. That is why it is important to know how you can find a single request or groups of requests as quickly as possible.

Do one of the following:

* Use lists, which are actually predefined searches.
* Use the search screen for requests in the Find request.
* Use the [free-text search][3] in the upper right corner.
* Use [dashboards][9].
* Use [selections][10] for requests.
* Use the [navigator][12] search on Requests.
* Use [Find][11] in the top bar, choose one of the typical searches or add wanted criteria.

## <a id="list"></a>Use lists

The simplest way to search for requests is to use the search field available in the menu for the first tab **Find request** on the Requests screen.

* **Last requests**: Shows the requests most recently recorded in the system. If specified in user preferences, this list will only contain requests from the categories you are a member of.

* **Own open requests**: Shows requests that belong to you and which have the **Open** status. This list contains the requests that you are responsible for, and is therefore the screen you will be working in most often.

* **Unassigned requests**: Lists requests that no-one is assigned responsibility for. To [take responsibility for one of the requests][6], it is important you do so by clicking **Accept request**. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time.

* **My favourites**: Shows the requests you have saved as favourites.

* **Get next in queue**: If the [queue system is set up][5] for your company, you can click this option to get the next unassigned request in the queue for the category you belong to.

* **Request selections**: Your own request selection will show in the menu.

### Show only own categories

1. Select ![icon][img2] **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.
1. Select the **Request** group.
1. Set **Show only own categories** to Yes.
1. Click **Save**.

### Customise search criteria

In practice, all these lists are predefined searches, and if you wish you can customise the search criteria:

1. Click **Find request** tab in the header of the Requests screen.
1. [Adjust the criteria][4].
1. Click **Find** in the bottom right corner to begin the search using the new search criteria. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the preview screen on the right. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the [preview section](#preview).
1. If you want to keep this search, you can save this search result as a [selection][13] and go back to the list whenever you want.

> [!TIP]
> To restore the default settings, select **Reset to default**.
>
> To clear all your criteria, select **Clear all**.

### <a id="result"></a>Search result

The result contains a list of requests that match the criteria specified above. Here you can:

* Sort the requests by clicking the appropriate column heading.
* Select a row to display the content of that request in the preview section.
* Open a request by double-clicking the relevant row.
* In the lower-left corner click the button to **Show/Hide preview**.
* On the ![icon][img1] **Task** button in the lower-left corner you can access different tasks to run on selected requests.

> [!TIP]
> The status **Open** together with the **Read** column will give an overview if the request were **Read by owner**, **New information**, or **Not read by owner**.

In the footer of the list, you can click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button to access the following options:

* **Export to Excel**: Click here to export the list under **Result** to an Excel file.

* **Bulk update**: If you select one or more requests in the list, you can click this option and select an action to perform on all the selected requests simultaneously. For example, you can choose to [add the same message to multiple requests][8], [forward multiple requests][7] or delete several requests in a single operation.

### Preview

This section of the screen displays the contents of the request selected under **Search result**. You have the same options as when [processing requests][6].

If the preview section is not visible, click **Show preview** at the bottom of the screen.
