# Find a request

As a customer support agent, you get a lot of incoming calls and emails about pending or old customer inquiries. That is why it is important to know how you can find a single request or groups of requests as quickly as possible.

Do one of the following:

* Use lists, which are actually predefined searches.
* Use the search screen for requests in the Find request.
* Use the [free-text search][12] in the top bar.
* Use [dashboards][18].
* Use [selections][10] for requests.
* Use the [navigator][19] search on Requests.
* Use [Find][11] in the top bar, choose one of the typical searches or add wanted criteria.

## <a id="list"></a>Use lists

The simplest way to search for requests is to use the search field available in the menu for the first tab **Find request** on the Requests screen.

![Search for requests -screenshot][img3]

* **Last requests:** Shows the requests most recently recorded in the system. If specified in user preferences, this list will only contain requests from the categories you are a member of.

* **Own open requests:** Shows requests that belong to you and which have the **Open** status. This list contains the requests that you are responsible for, and is therefore the screen you will be working in most often.

* **Unassigned requests:** Lists requests that no-one is assigned responsibility for. To [take responsibility for one of the requests][6], it is important you do so by clicking **Accept request**. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time.

* **My favourites:** Shows the requests you have saved as favourites.

* **Get next in queue:** If the [queue system is set up][9] for your company, you can click this option to get the next unassigned request in the queue for the category you belong to.

* **Request selections:** Your own request selection will show in the menu.

### Show only own categories

1. Select <i class="ph ph-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.
1. Select the **Request** group.
1. Set **Show only own categories** to Yes.
1. Click **Save**.

## Use search criteria

You can customize search criteria to locate specific requests.

### How to access the search criteria

The **Find request** tab has two interactive elements:

* **Tab text:** Clicking the text opens the search criteria screen.

* **Dropdown chevron:** Clicking the chevron (<i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Dropdown icon"></i>) opens a menu of predefined searches, such as *Last requests* or *Own open requests*.
If you cannot see the search criteria screen, ensure you click the text, not the chevron.

### Customizing criteria

1. Click the **Find request** text in the header of the Requests screen. The **Criteria** tab opens.

1. Adjust the [search criteria][14] by adding or modifying filters:

    * Use the dropdowns to set criteria such as Owner, Internal status, or Category.
    * Add additional criteria by clicking **Add criterion** or remove existing ones with the <i class="ph ph-x" aria-label="Remove criterion"></i> icon.
    * Combine filters using the **AND** or **OR** options to refine your search.

1. Click **Find** in the lower-right corner to run the search.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can save frequently used criteria as a [selection][13] for easy access later.

1. To reset the search to default criteria, select **Reset to default**. To clear all filters, select **Clear all**.

### <a id="result"></a>Search result

The results of your search are displayed as a list of requests in the **Results** tab. You can:

* Sort the requests by clicking the column headings.
* Click a request to display its details in the preview section on the right.
* Double-click a request to open it for further action.
* Use the **Show/Hide preview** button at the bottom of the screen to toggle the preview section.
* Access bulk actions or export options by clicking the <i class="ph ph-list" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Task** button. For example, you can choose to favorite or delete several requests in a single operation.

> [!TIP]
> The status **Open** together with the **Read** column will give an overview if the request were **Read by owner**, **New information**, or **Not read by owner**.

### <a id="preview"></a>Preview

This section of the screen displays the contents of the request selected under **Search result**. You have the same options as when [processing requests][6].

If the preview section is not visible, click **Show preview** at the bottom of the screen.
