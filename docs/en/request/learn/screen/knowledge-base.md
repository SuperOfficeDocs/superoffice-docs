# Knowledge Base

The **Knowledge base** is accessible from the **Main menu** in the top bar and gives request handlers access to saved data in a single location, which makes it easier to find information and make it available to contacts. You can use the knowledge base both as a look-up tool and for extracting information to reuse in communications with contacts. The knowledge base comprises the following main sections:

* **FAQ**: Contains a [list of frequently asked questions][2] and their answers. These entries can be made available in a web-based customer centre, where contacts themselves can search for answers, and request handlers can add links to FAQ entries when replying to enquiries.

* **Reply templates**: Contains a list of all the [reply templates][3] in the system. A reply template consists of predefined text that can be pasted into a message to a contact or into a chat session.

* **External documents**: Here you can [add documents and files][1] to make them available to anyone using SuperOffice Marketing or Service, including unregistered contacts.

* **Email addresses**: Here you can [create a list of email addresses][4] that you use frequently so that they are accessible in most places you send emails. These addresses can for example be a group email address or people who are neither users nor registered as contacts in SuperOffice.
