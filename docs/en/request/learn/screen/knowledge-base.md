# Knowledge Base

The knowledge base gives request handlers access to saved data in a single location, which makes it easier to find information and make it available to customers. You can use the knowledge base both as a look-up tool and for extracting information to reuse in communications with customers. The knowledge base comprises the following main sections:

* **Search**: Here you can [search for content in all entries in the knowledge base][1].

* **Documents**: Here you can [add documents][2] to make them available to yourself and/or other users. Such documents may include price lists, installation routines and brochures.

* **External documents**: Here you can [add documents][3] to make them available to anyone using SuperOffice Service, including unregistered customers.

* **Email addresses**: Here you can [create a list of email addresses][4] that you use frequently, for example, people who are neither users nor registered as contacts in SuperOffice Service. These addresses will then be accessible in most places where you may want to send an email.

* **FAQ**: This contains a [list of frequently asked questions][5] and their answers. These entries can be made available in a web-based customer centre, where customers themselves can search for answers, and request handlers can add links to FAQ entries when replying to enquiries.

* **Reply templates**: Here you will find a list of all the [reply templates][6] in the system. A reply template consists of ready-made text that can be pasted into a message you are writing to a customer.
