# Request status

All requests that are registered in SuperOffice have a status, such as **Open**, **Closed** or **Postponed**. Select **Request** in the navigator and in the **Request status** tab, you can see the request statuses already defined in the system, and create additional request statuses. A request status must be linked to one of the system's internal statuses, such as **Open** or **Closed**. Each internal status must be linked to at least one request status.

For example, you can create a new status called "Waiting for reply" as a more detailed variant of either **Closed** or **Open**, depending on how you want the system to process and report this status internally. You can also link custom logic to such statuses to streamline your business processes.

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | The name of the request status. By default each internal status has a request status with the same name. |
| Internal status | The system's internal statuses. Each internal status must be linked to at least one request status. The system statuses **Linked** and **Deleted** are only used for merged requests and deleted requests respectively, and are not visible to the users. |
| Default | Indicates if this is a default status for the internal status. |
| Queue status | Indicates if requests with this status should be placed in the queue. Relevant if you use the **Get next request in queue** function. |
| Track time as | Used to report time usage in various phases of request management. The system calculates time used both in relation to defined "opening hours" and the whole 24-hour period. Choose from: in queue and awaiting processing; at internal decision stage; at external decision stage |
