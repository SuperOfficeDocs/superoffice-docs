# Delete request status

> [!NOTE]
> because every internal status must be linked to at least one request status, you cannot delete the only request status linked to an internal status. You cannot delete statuses that are defined as defaults (those with a check mark in the **Default** column in the **Request status** tab).

## Delete a status in Settings and maintenance

1. Click the **Requests** button in the navigator.

1. Select the **Request status** tab.

1. Click the required request status.

1. Click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the screen.

1. If there are requests with this request status, these must be transferred to another request status in the list **Transfer request status to**.

1. Click **OK**. The request status is deleted.
