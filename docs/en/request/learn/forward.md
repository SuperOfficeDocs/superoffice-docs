# Forward request to external contact

As a request handler, you are not always able to answer a request, even with the help of your colleagues. Sometimes, you may need to ask for help from others, for example, by getting advice from a sub-supplier, a partner, or a business specialist.

You can forward a complex or problematic request to an external contact in an email. After the person on the other end responds, their email will automatically be saved in the request in SuperOffice. Of course, the customer will not receive any of this email communication. When you have the solution for your customer, you can answer the customer by replying in the request.

## Forward a message

1. [Open the request][1] and go to the **Messages** tab.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-arrow-bend-up-right" aria-label="Forward"></i> or click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> on the message you want to forward, and select **Forward**. A new message opens in edit mode.
