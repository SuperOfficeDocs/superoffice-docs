# Split a request

If a single request contains several questions, for example, if the customer first asks a technical question and then uses the opportunity to raise an invoicing query, you can split the request into two.

> [!TIP]
> You can also [split a message][1].

## Steps

1. [Open the request][2].

1. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **Split**.

    This opens up a dialog, where you specify information about the new request.

1. In the tab **Properties of the new request**, you have the different fields to fil in.

1. In the **Title** field, enter a descriptive name for the request.

1. In the **Category** field, select a category for the request.

1. In the **Priority** list box, you can choose between **Low**, **Medium** and **High**, or you can make the system assign the priority automatically. This can be done, for example, on the basis of [escalation levels][3] set for different contacts and companies.

1. In the **Access level** list box, select one of the following options:
    * **External**: Select this option if the contact is to have access to the request via SuperOffice Customer Centre.
    * **Internal**: Select this option if the contact is not to have access to the request.

1. In the **Status** list box, choose one of the following:
    * **Open**: Select this option if the request is in progress.
    * **Closed**: Select this option if the request is completed.
    * **Postponed**: To postpone handling of this request, select this option and specify a date in the date field to the right. On this date, the request is set back to **Open**.

1. Select the **Messages** tab where you will find a list of messages involved in the request. Here you select the messages you want to move to the new request.

1. Click **OK**. The request is split.
