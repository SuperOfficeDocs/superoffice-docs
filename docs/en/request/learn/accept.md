# Accept (take responsibility for) request

This is particularly relevant for unassigned requests (those without a defined owner). To take over a request, it is important to follow the procedures below to identify that you have claimed it. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time.

| Context | Steps |
|---|---|
| You clicked **Get next request in queue** | Accept (the request is already open) |
| You want more information before accepting | Open and accept |
| Quickly accept one or more requests from a list | Select **Accept** from the context menu |

## Accept directly from a list of request

When viewing a list of requests:

1. Right-click the request in a list.
1. Select **Accept** from the pop-up context menu.

If you need more information before accepting, or use [Get next request in queue][6]:

1. [Open the request][1].
1. Accept:

    * Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **Accept**.
    * Or, in the **Owner** field, select yourself.
