# Forward request to external contact

As a request handler, you are not always able to answer a request, even with the help of your colleagues. Sometimes, you may need to ask for help from others, for example, by getting advice from a sub-supplier, a partner, or a business specialist.

You can forward a complex or problematic request to an external contact in an email. After the person on the other end responds, their email will automatically be saved in the request in SuperOffice. Of course, the customer will not receive any of this email communication. When you have the solution for your customer, you can answer the customer by replying in the request.

## Forward a message

1. [Open the request][1].

1. Click the **Messages** tab.

1. Click on the ![icon][img4] **Forward** button or click on ![icon][img1] **Task menu** on the message you want to forward, and select **Forward**. A new message opens in edit mode.

1. Add a recipient in the **To** field. Click the **Cc/Bcc** button (to the right of the message) to add recipients on copy or blind copy.

1. [Edit the message][2].

1. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as attachments to the request.

1. Click **Send**. The message is sent.

## Forward multiple requests

In a request list, you can forward multiple requests at a time.

1. Select the requests you want to forward in the request list.

1. Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button in the lower left corner of the request list.

1. Select **Manage** and **Forward requests**.

1. Under **Add recipient(s)**, add a recipient in the **To** field. Click the **Cc/Bcc** button (on the right-hand side of the message) to add recipients on copy or blind copy.

1. If you check **Close request after forwarding**, the requests are closed once they are forwarded.

1. Under **Comment**, you can enter a comment, which will then be added both to the email message and to the request as an internal message.

1. Click **Forward**. The requests are sent.
