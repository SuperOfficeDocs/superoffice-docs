# Forward to external parties

As a request handler, you are not always able to answer a request, even with the help of your colleagues. Sometimes, you may need to ask for help from others, for example, by getting advice from a sub-supplier.

## Forward a message

1. [Open the request][1].
2. Click the **Messages** tab.
3. Click ![icon][img1] on the message you want to forward, and select **Forward**. A new message opens in edit mode.
4. Add a recipient in the **To** field. Click the **Cc/Bcc** button (on the right-hand side of the message) to add recipients on copy or blind copy.
5. [Edit the message][2].
6. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as attachments to the request.
7. Click **Send**. The message is sent.

## Forward multiple requests

In the request lists, you can forward multiple requests at a time.

1. Select the requests you want to forward in the request list.

2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button in the lower left corner of the request list.

3. Select **Manage** and **Forward requests**.

4. Under **Add recipient(s)**, add a recipient in the **To** field. Click the **Cc/Bcc** button (on the right-hand side of the message) to add recipients on copy or blind copy.

5. If you check **Close request after forwarding**, the requests are closed once they are forwarded.

6. Under **Comment**, you can enter a comment, which will then be added both to the email message and to the request as an internal message.

7. Click **Forward**. The requests are sent.
