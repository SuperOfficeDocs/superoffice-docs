# Split message

If a message contains two issues that should be handled separately, you can split the message in two and create a new request with one of the messages. This can be relevant if a message contains both a technical question and an invoice question, since these two issues are handled by two different departments.

1. [Open the request][1].

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. In the **Messages** tab, click the ![icon][img1] menu button next to the message you want to split.

1. In the **Split message** screen in the **Title** field, enter a descriptive name for the new request.

1. In the **Messages** tab, click the ![icon][img1] menu button and select **Split message**.

1. In the **Split message** dialog and the **Title** field, enter a descriptive name for the new request.

1. In the **Category** field, select a category.

1. In the **Owner** list box, choose one of the following:
    * To assign the request to a specific person, select the name you require.
    * **(Automatically assigned)**: If selected, the system assigns the request in accordance with the applicable assignment rules.
    * **(Unassigned)**: You can also choose not to assign the request. The members of the relevant category then become responsible for dealing with the request.

1. In the **Priority** list box, you can choose between **Low**, **Medium** and **High**, or you can make the system assign the priority automatically. This can be done, for example, on the basis of escalation levels set for different customers.

1. In the **Access level** list box, select one of the following options:
    * **External**: Select this option if the customer is to have access to the request via a customer centre.
    * **Internal**: Select this option if the customer is not to have access to the request.

1. In the **Status** list box, choose one of the following:
    * **Open**: Select this option if the request is in progress.
    * **Closed**: Select this option if the request is completed.
    * **Postponed**: To postpone handling of this request, select this option and specify a date in the date field to the right. On this date, the request is set back to **Open**.
