# Edit message

Only users with the *general administrator* functional right can edit the properties of a message in a request. However, it is not possible to edit the text of the message.

1. [Open the request][1].
1. Click the **Messages** tab.
1. Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button and select **Change**.
1. Here you have the following options:
    * **Author**: Shows the name of the person who created the request.
    * **Time spent**: Shows the amount of time spent on this message.
    * **Access level**: The access level for this message. You can choose between **External** and **Internal**.
    * **Attachments**: If the message contains attachments, they are shown in this table. You can delete existing attachments, but you cannot add new ones.

1. Click **Save** when you are finished, or **Cancel** if you want to discard the changes. You can also delete the entire message by clicking **Delete** and then **OK**.
