# Add requests to your favourites list

In SuperOffice there is a favourites list where you can add requests you want to remind yourself to follow up.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add contacts, companies, selections and mailings to your [favourites][1]. These favourites can be accessed by clicking the relevant item in the Navigator and clicking favourites ![icon][img3].

## Add one request

1. [Open the request][3].
1. Click the favourites icon ![icon][img1] in the request header. The star turns yellow ![icon][img2], and the request is instantly added to your favourites. You do not have to click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> Before [transferring responsibility][2] for the request to someone else, it is a good idea to add it to your favourites list, to remind yourself to follow up the request. It will no longer be displayed under **Own open requests** when someone else is defined in the **Owner** field.

## Add multiple requests

1. Search for the relevant requests.
1. Select the requests you want to add to the favourites list by holding down Ctrl and clicking them.
1. Click ![icon][img5] **Task** in the lower left corner of the screen.
1. Select **Add to my favourites**.

## View the favourites list

Do the following:

* Select **Requests** in the Navigator, and click ![icon][img3] .

## Remove requests from the favourites list

1. Open the request.
1. Click the favourites icon ![icon][img2] in the request header. The icon changes to ![icon][img1].
