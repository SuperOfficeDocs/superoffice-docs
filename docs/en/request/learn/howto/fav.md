# Add requests to the favorites list

In SuperOffice Service there is a favorites list, you can add requests you want to remind yourself to follow up.

> [!TIP]
> You can also add contacts, companies, selections and mailings to your [favorites][1]. These favorites can be accessed by clicking the relevant icon in the Navigator and clicking ![icon][img3].

## Add one request

1. [Open the request][3].
2. Click the favorites icon ![icon][img1] in the request header. The star turns yellow ![icon][img2], and the request is instantly added to favorites. You do not have to click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> Before [transferring responsibility][2] for the request to someone else, it is a good idea to add it to your favorites list, to remind yourself to follow it up. It will no longer be displayed under **Own open requests** when someone else is defined in the **Owner** field.

## Add multiple requests

1. Search for the relevant requests.
2. Click the checkbox next to each request you want to add to the favorites list.
3. Click ![icon][img5] in the lower left corner of the list.
4. Select **Batch management** > **Add to my favorites**.

## View the favorites list

Do one of the following:

* Select **Requests** in the Navigator, and click ![icon][img3].
* Select **Requests** in the Navigator, and select **My favorites**.
* Go to **Dashboard**, click the list button ![icon][img6] next to the title of a panel, and select **My favorites**.

## Remove requests from the favorites list

1. Open the request.
2. Click the favorites icon ![icon][img2] in the request header. The icon changes to ![icon][img1].
