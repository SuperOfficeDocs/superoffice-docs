# Reply to customer

In request handling, your most important task is to respond to enquiries.

1. [Open the request][1].
2. Click ![icon][img1] and select **Reply** or **Reply to all**. The **Message** tab in the **Request** screen appears. The contact is automatically added as a recipient in the **To** field.
3. Type in the [message][2] you want to add to the request.
4. Since this message should be visible to the customer, verify that **External** appears in the toolbar at the bottom of the tab.
5. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as [attachments to the request][2].
6. Click **OK**. The message is sent to the customer.

## Add reply templates to messages

When you respond to an customer enquiry, you can save time by using a reply template as your basis.

1. Go to the **Message** tab, as described above.

2. Position the mouse pointer in the message where you want to insert the reply template.

3. Click the list button ![icon][img3], and select what to insert in the message.

    Optional: Select a language in the language list. If available, the text is inserted in the selected language. Otherwise the default language is used.

4. In the list that appears, first click **Reply template** and then the entry you want.

5. Click **Paste at cursor position**. The reply template text is inserted.

6. Review the text and make any adjustments.
