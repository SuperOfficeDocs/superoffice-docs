# Request management

Incoming requests can arrive through many channels, and there is more than one way to register and reply to them. How request handling progresses will vary from request to request.

A contact service system is all about providing your contacts the answers they are looking for and saving their contact information. Whenever you reply to a contact, they will receive an email from you. Which is why it is important to [create your email signature][15].

## Typical tasks

* [Take responsibility for requests][1]
* [Ask another request handler for help][2]
* [Reply to contact][4]
* [Edit message][9]
* [Split requests][5]
* [Forward messages or multiple requests to external parties][3]
* [Add requests to the favorites list][6]
* [Close requests][7]

Different companies have different routines for request handling and can use SuperOffice Service in different ways. Below we have set up two real-life scenarios showing some of the available options. These scenarios will show you how you can reply efficiently when a contact has submitted a request by email and when a contact calls in with a problem or a question.

## Scenario 1: The contact submits the request by email

1. The contact writes an email to support@company.com or fills out a form in a user-support portal.
1. The contact receives [automatic acknowledgement][11] of receipt of the enquiry.
1. The enquiry from the contact is automatically registered as a request in SuperOffice CRM.
1. The request ends up with a request handler in SuperOffice CRM. See [Assign requests][12] and [Find requests][13].
1. The request handler reads through the request.
1. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on their own and does one of the following:
    * [Asks a colleague][2].
    * [Gets help from outside][3].
1. The request handler [sends a response to the contact][4].
1. The request handler [closes the request][7] and proceeds to deal with other requests.

## Scenario 2: The contact calls the request handler

1. The contact has a problem with a product and calls user-support.
1. The request handler who answers the call [registers the request][14].
1. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on their own and does one of the following:
    * [Asks a colleague][2].
    * [Gets help from outside][3].
1. The request handler [sends a response to the contact][4].
1. The request handler [closes the request][7] and proceeds to deal with other requests.

## <a id="ai" />Efficient handling of requests using AI

> [!NOTE]
> AI services require a separate license. SuperOffice AI is cloud only and is a separate add-on.

The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in SuperOffice 10 gives request handlers / support agents a new set of smart tools to make their workday more efficient.

### Language detection

This functionality automatically detects the language of an incoming request. The detected language is displayed under the message.

### Translation

If you receive a message in a language you cannot read, you can click the **Translate from** ***language*** below the message. The subject and body of the message is translated and added below the original message.

### Sentiment analysis

Is the contact happy or angry?

* Negative ![icon][img2]
* Neutral ![icon][img3]
* Positive ![icon][img4]

If this function is active, incoming email requests are analysed to determine the "mood" of the contact. An emoticon below the message will indicate the detected sentiment (happy, unhappy or neutral).

### Automatic categorisation

Save time by letting the system categorise requests for you. If this function is active, incoming email requests are analysed to determine the best category for each request. In the footer of a request, you will see the category suggested by the system. Click the category link to update the request with the suggested category.
