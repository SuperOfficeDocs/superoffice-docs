# Request management

How request handling progresses will vary from request to request.

## Typical tasks

* [Take responsibility for requests][1]
* [Ask another request handler for help.][2]
* [Reply to customer][4]
* [Split requests][5]
* [Forward messages or multiple requests to external parties][3]
* [Add requests to the favorites list][6]
* [Close requests][7]
* [Add message][8]
* [Edit message][9]

Different companies have different routines for request handling and can use SuperOffice Requests in different ways. Below we have set up two scenarios showing some of the available options.

## Scenario 1: The customer submits the request by email

1. The customer writes an email to support@company.com or fills out a form in a user-support portal.
1. The customer receives [automatic acknowledgement][11] of receipt of the enquiry.
1. The enquiry from the customer is automatically registered as a request in SuperOffice CRM.
1. The request ends up with a request handler in SuperOffice CRM. See [Assign requests][12] and [Find requests][13].
1. The request handler reads through the request.
1. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on their own and does one of the following:
    * [Asks a colleague][2].
    * [Gets help from outside][3].
1. The request handler [sends a response to the customer][4].
1. The request handler [closes the request][7] and proceeds to deal with other requests.

## Scenario 2: The customer calls the request handler

1. The customer has a problem with a product and calls user-support.
1. The request handler who answers the call [registers the request][14].
1. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on their own and does one of the following:
    * [Asks a colleague][2].
    * [Gets help from outside][3].
1. The request handler [sends a response to the customer][4].
1. The request handler [closes the request][7] and proceeds to deal with other requests.

## <a id="ai" />Efficient handling of requests using AI

> [!NOTE]
> AI services require a separate license. SuperOffice AI is cloud only and is a separate add-on.

The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in SuperOffice 10 gives request handlers / support agents a new set of smart tools to make their workday more efficient.

### Language detection

This functionality automatically detects the language of an incoming request. The detected language is displayed under the message.

### Translation

If you receive a message in a language you cannot read, you can click the **Translate from** ***language*** below the message. The subject and body of the message is translated and added below the original message.

### Sentiment analysis

(is the customer happy or angry?)

If this function is active, incoming email requests are analysed to determine the "mood" of the customer. An emoticon below the message will indicate the detected sentiment (happy, unhappy or neutral).

### Automatic categorisation

Save time by letting the system categorise requests for you. If this function is active, incoming email requests are analysed to determine the best category for each request. In the footer of a request, you will see the category suggested by the system. Click the category link to update the request with the suggested category.
