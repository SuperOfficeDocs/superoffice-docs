# Ask another request handler for help

As a request handler, you are not always able to answer the request on your own. You may sometimes need to ask for help from a colleague.

1. [Open the request][1].

2. Click ![icon][img1] **Actions** and select **Edit request**. This takes you to the **Properties** tab in the **Request** screen.

3. Select the person you want to help in the **Owner** list box. This means that you are transferring responsibility for the request to that person.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not know who should have responsibility for the request, you can select **(Automatically assigned)** in the **Owner** field and select the relevant [category][3] in the **Category** field. If, for example, the request relates to a payment question, you can change the category to "Invoicing". The request will then be automatically assigned to a request handler in the invoicing department in accordance with the applicable assignment rules.

4. Select the **Message** tab.

5. Enter the question you want to ask the other person.

6. Set **Access level for message** to **Internal**.

7. Click **OK**. The request is transferred to the other person.

> [!TIP]
> Before transferring responsibility for the request to someone else, it is a good idea to [add it to your favorites list][2], to remind yourself to follow it up. It will no longer be displayed under **Own open requests** when someone else is defined in the **Owner** field.
