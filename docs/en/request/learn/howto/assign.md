# Automatic assignment methods for requests

[!include[Owner](../includes/request-owner.md)] This can be set manually, for example when the [request is created][2]. But it may also be the result of automatic assignment of requests. Such assignment depends on the category the request belongs to, and the assignment method specified for this category.

## Assignment methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| Even assignment | Assigns requests evenly among the members of the category. |
| Weighted assignment | Assigns requests based on the [weightings][3] specified for members of the category. |
| To user with fewest open requests | Assigns new requests to the category members who has the fewest active requests. |
| Do not assign | Does not assign requests to specific request handlers, but puts all requests in a queue as **Unassigned**. |

Let us illustrate these assignment methods with three users and three incoming requests.

### Even

Assigns requests evenly among category members in a round-robin fashion.

### Weighted

Assigns requests based on specified weightings for each category member. For example, if member A has a weight of 1, member B has 2, and member C has 5, over 8 requests, they will be assigned proportionally.

Requests are assigned probabilistically based on their weights.

| Request | Random value | Assigned to |
|---|:-:|---|
| First request | 7 | Member C |
| Second request| 2 | Member B |
| Third request | 5 | Member C |

### User with fewest open requests

Assigns new requests to the member with the fewest active requests.

| Request | Condition | Assigned to |
|---|---|---|
| First request | Members B and C have the fewest requests | Member C |
| Second request| Member B has the fewest requests | Member B |
| Third request | All members have the same number of requests | Member B |

### Do not assign

Does not assign requests to specific members. All requests are placed in a queue by default.

[!include[Get next request in queue](includes/howto-get-next-request.md)]

## Specify assignment method for category

A request handler with category administration rights can specify the assignment method for categories:

1. [!include[Go to](../../../learn/includes/goto-sm.md)]
1. Select **Requests** > **Categories**.
1. Select the required category.
1. Select the **Assignment method** tab.
1. Select the appropriate options.
1. Click **OK**.

## Example

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD034 -->
Imagine that your company has created a category for each department in the company: User support, Sales, Accounts, and so on. And you have also specified that all emails sent to support@company.com should be automatically assigned to the "User support" category. All the staff in the user support department are members of this category. For this category they have set the **Even assignment** method. This means that all the members of the category will get the same number of requests, and each of the members will continuously receive new requests in their **Own open requests** screen. If, alternatively, they had selected the **Do not assign** method, the members would have had to go into the **Unassigned requests** screen themselves to [take ownership of new requests][4].
