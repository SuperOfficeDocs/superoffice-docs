In general, it is not recommended to delete a request. However, you may have to delete a request to comply with your company's privacy policy. All messages and attachments/files linked to the request are also deleted.

1. [Open the request you want to delete][1].
1. Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button and select **Delete**.
1. Confirm whether you really want to delete the request by clicking **Yes** or **No**.

> [!NOTE]
> The request is not deleted from the database immediately. The status of the request is set to Deleted, so it is still possible to open and edit the request. The request will then be permanently deleted from the database after 14 days (system setting). You can access the deleted request in the [Recycle bin][?].
