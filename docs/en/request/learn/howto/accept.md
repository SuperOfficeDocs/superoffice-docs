# Accept or take responsibility for requests

This is particularly relevant for unassigned requests (those without a defined owner). To take over a request, it is important to follow the procedure below to identify that you have taken it over. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time.

1. [Open the request][1].
1. Accept:

    * Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button and select **Accept**.
    * Or, in the **Owner** field, select yourself.

[!include[Get next request in queue](includes/howto-get-next-request.md)]

Or you can easily right click on the request in a list (to get the context menu) and select **Accept** in the menu.
