# Requests

**Requests** is the main feature of SuperOffice Service. Here you manage requests and enquiries that are in the system. You can also create internal and external requests, respond to incoming enquiries and obtain an overview of the statuses of all requests in the system. When you open SuperOffice Service or click ![icon][img1] **Dashboard** in the Navigator, you arrive at the [Dashboard][1], which provides an overview of request handling. Click ![icon][img2] **Requests** to show relevant options for requests.

## <a id="open" />Where can I access requests?

* [Pre-defined lists][11]
* [Search][12]
* [Favorites][14]
* [Flagged messages][15]

When you double-click a row in the [search results screen][13], you are taken to the **Request** screen.

## <a id="customers" />Customers

Requests can be linked to [contacts][2], who in turn can belong to a [company][6]. This means that requests cannot be linked directly to companies (only indirectly via contacts). When new emails are imported and saved as requests, the request is automatically linked to the correct contact via the email address. When you view a request, it is easy to see who the contact is, and if you click the contact's name, you can see which other requests are registered for this person. This provides you with a rapid overview of previous communication with this same contact.

## Request header

The header of the request contains the properties defined when the [request was created][4]. The header consists of the request title, request ID, contact and deadline. In addition, you can click ![icon][img3] to set the request as a favorite ![icon][img4]. The request will then be accessible via **My favorites** under **Requests** in the Navigator, and in the **My favorites** tile on the dashboard.

## Message types

There are three types of messages:

* **Enquiries** from customers or other external parties
* **Replies** to these enquiries, possibly asking for more details
* Internal comments about the request, such as questions to a colleague

> [!TIP]
> Internal messages are marked with ![icon][img5].
