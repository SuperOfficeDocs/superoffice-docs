# Requests and SuperOffice Service

Our ticketing system allows you to efficiently handle incoming requests and helps you offer outstanding customer service every day. This selection of how-to guides contains guidelines to help you keep track of, answer and analyze all incoming questions and inquiries using SuperOffice Service. No matter whether they come in by phone, email, chat, web form, or other channels.

**Requests** is one of the main features of SuperOffice. Here you manage requests and enquiries that are in the system. You can also create internal and external requests, respond to incoming enquiries and obtain an overview of the statuses of all requests in the system. Click the ![icon][img2] **Requests** button to open the Requests screen or click the **Requests** text to open the navigator options with search, history and faviourites.

Each question and query can be defined as a request. These questions range from support issues, questions about the product and services, or questions about invoices. Whenever a request comes in, you want to handle them as quickly and efficiently as possible and professional customer service.

## <a id="open" />Where can I access requests?

* [Pre-defined lists][11]
* [Search][12]
* [Favourites][8]
* [Flagged messages][5]

When you double-click a row in the [search results screen][13], you are taken to the Request screen.

## <a id="customers" />Contacts

Requests can be linked to [contacts][2], who in turn can belong to a [company][3]. This means that requests cannot be linked directly to companies (only indirectly via contacts). When new emails are imported and saved as requests, the request is automatically linked to the correct contact via the email address. When you view a request, it is easy to see who the contact is, and if you click the contact's name, you can see which other requests are registered for this person. This provides you with a rapid overview of previous communication with this same contact.

## Request header

The header of the request contains the properties defined when the [request was created][4]. The header consists of the request title, contact, deadline and request ID (in the tab). In addition, you can click ![icon][img3] to set the request as a ![icon][img4] favourite. The request will then be accessible via **My favourites** on **Requests** in the Navigator, and in the **My favourites** tile on a [dashboard][1].

## Message types

There are three types of messages:

* **Enquiries** from contacts or other external parties
* **Replies** to these enquiries, possibly asking for more details
* Internal comments about the request, such as questions to a colleague

> [!TIP]
> Internal messages are marked with ![icon][img5].
