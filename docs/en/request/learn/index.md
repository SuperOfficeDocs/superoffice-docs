# Requests and SuperOffice Service

Our ticketing system allows you to efficiently handle incoming requests and helps you offer outstanding customer service every day. This selection of how-to guides contains guidelines to help you keep track of, answer and analyze all incoming questions and inquiries using SuperOffice Service. No matter whether they come in by phone, email, chat, web form, or other channels.

**Requests** is one of the main features of SuperOffice. Here you manage requests and enquiries that are in the system. You can also create internal and external requests, respond to incoming enquiries and obtain an overview of the statuses of all requests in the system. Click the **Requests** button (<i class="ph ph-ticket" aria-hidden="true"></i>) to open the Requests screen or click the **Requests** text to open the navigator options with search, history and favourites.

Each question and query can be defined as a request. These questions range from support issues, questions about the product and services, or questions about invoices. Whenever a request comes in, you want to handle them as quickly and efficiently as possible and professional customer service.

## <a id="open"></a>Where can I access requests?

* Section tabs in the Company, Contact, Sale, and Project screens.
* [Pre-defined lists][10]
* [Search][12]
* [Favourites][18]
* [Flagged messages][5]

When you double-click a row in the search results, you are taken to the Request screen.

### <a id="customers"></a>Contacts

Requests can be linked to [contacts][14], who in turn can belong to a [company][13]. This means that requests cannot be linked directly to companies (only indirectly via contacts). When new emails are imported and saved as requests, the request is automatically linked to the correct contact via the email address. When you view a request, it is easy to see who the contact is, and if you click the contact's name, you can see which other requests are registered for this person. This provides you with a rapid overview of previous communication with this same contact.

## Request screen

The Request screen has the following sections:

* At the top of the screen, the **request header** contains basic information about the request, like id, title, contact and deadline.
* The **request properties** sidebar contains fields for Owner, Status, Category, Priority, Access level and Tags, all fields are editable with **Save** and **Cancel** buttons.
* Below the header is a row of buttons for performing tasks associated with requests, such as Reply, Reply all, Forward, and Add comment.
* The **Messages** tab displays the messages related to the request.
* The **Details** tab contains an overview of the data registered for the request.
* The **Change log** tab contains the history of this request. The request log shows everything that has happened to this request since it was first registered.

### Request header

The header of the request contains the properties defined when the [request was created][4]. The header consists of the request title, contact, deadline and request ID (in the tab). In addition, you can click <i class="ph ph-star" aria-label="Star icon"></i> to set the request as a favorite. The request will then be accessible via **My favorites** on **Requests** in the Navigator, and in the **My favorites** tile on a [dashboard][17].

### Messages tab

The **Messages** tab displays the messages related to the request.

You can change how many messages are displayed, in **Personal settings**:

1. Select <i class="ph ph-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.
1. Select the group for **Request**.
1. Specify the number of messages in the **No. of expanded messages** field.
1. Click **OK**.

#### Message types

There are three types of messages:

* **Enquiries** from contacts or other external parties
* **Replies** to these enquiries, possibly asking for more details
* Internal comments about the request, such as questions to a colleague

> [!TIP]
> Internal messages are marked with <i class="ph ph-dots-three" aria-label="Three dots"></i>.

#### Message tasks

Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> on a message to access additional options for the message:

At the top of the **Messages** tab, you can send replies and forward messages, and you can also add comments as internal messages.

* **Access level**: Select one of the following options:
  * **External**: Select this option if the contact is to have access to the request via the SuperOffice Customer Centre.
  * **Internal**: Select this option if the contact is not to have access to the request. The request will be listed in SuperOffice Customer Centre, but the contact cannot view the request details or messages.

* **Tags**: In the **Tags** list box, [select relevant tags][22] for this request.

### Task options

**Task** button: Click this button to access the following options:

* **Edit**: Click here to edit the properties for this request. For example, you can assign the request to another request handler if you need to [ask a colleague for advice][7].
* **Accept**: Click here to [take over the request][1]. You will then be the request's new owner.
* **Split**: If a single request contains several questions, for example, if the customer first asks a technical question and then uses the opportunity to raise an invoicing query, you can [split the request][11] into two using this button.
* **Merge**: Click here to merge this request with one or more other requests. For example, if multiple contacts in the same company report the same technical issue (via phone, web forms and email), you can [merge these requests][16] into one request that will be processed.
* **Print**: Click here to print the request.
* **Delete**: Click here to delete the request.

## <a id="request-mgt"></a>Request management

Incoming requests can arrive through many channels, and there is more than one way to register and reply to them. How request handling progresses will vary from request to request.

A contact service system is all about providing your contacts the answers they are looking for and saving their contact information. Whenever you reply to a contact, they will receive an email from you. Which is why it is important to [create your email signature][15].

### Typical tasks

* [Take responsibility for requests][1]
* [Ask another request handler for help][7]
* [Reply to contact][2]
* [Edit message][9]
* [Split requests][11]
* [Forward messages or multiple requests to external parties][8]
* [Add requests to the favorites list][18]
* [Close requests][3]

Different companies have different routines for request handling and can use SuperOffice Service in different ways. Below we have set up two real-life scenarios showing some of the available options. These scenarios will show you how you can reply efficiently when a contact has submitted a request by email and when a contact calls in with a problem or a question.
