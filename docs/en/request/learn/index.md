# Requests and SuperOffice Service

Our ticketing system allows you to efficiently handle incoming requests and helps you offer outstanding customer service every day. This selection of how-to guides contains guidelines to help you keep track of, answer and analyze all incoming questions and inquiries using SuperOffice Service. No matter whether they come in by phone, email, chat, web form, or other channels.

**Requests** is one of the main features of SuperOffice. Here you manage requests and enquiries that are in the system. You can also create internal and external requests, respond to incoming enquiries and obtain an overview of the statuses of all requests in the system. Click the **Requests** button (<i class="ph ph-ticket" aria-hidden="true"></i>) to open the Requests screen or click the **Requests** text to open the navigator options with search, history and favourites.

Each question and query can be defined as a request. These questions range from support issues, questions about the product and services, or questions about invoices. Whenever a request comes in, you want to handle them as quickly and efficiently as possible and professional customer service.

## <a id="open"></a>Where can I access requests?

* Section tabs in the Company, Contact, Sale, and Project screens.
* [Pre-defined lists][10]
* [Search][12]
* [Favourites][18]
* [Flagged messages][5]

When you double-click a row in the search results, you are taken to the Request screen.

### <a id="customers"></a>Contacts

Requests can be linked to [contacts][14], who in turn can belong to a [company][13]. This means that requests cannot be linked directly to companies (only indirectly via contacts). When new emails are imported and saved as requests, the request is automatically linked to the correct contact via the email address. When you view a request, it is easy to see who the contact is, and if you click the contact's name, you can see which other requests are registered for this person. This provides you with a rapid overview of previous communication with this same contact.

## <a id="request-mgt"></a>Request management

Incoming requests can arrive through many channels, and there is more than one way to register and reply to them. How request handling progresses will vary from request to request.

A contact service system is all about providing your contacts the answers they are looking for and saving their contact information. Whenever you reply to a contact, they will receive an email from you. Which is why it is important to [create your email signature][15].

### Typical tasks

* [Take responsibility for requests][1]
* [Ask another request handler for help][7]
* [Reply to contact][2]
* [Edit message][9]
* [Split requests][11]
* [Forward messages or multiple requests to external parties][8]
* [Add requests to the favorites list][18]
* [Close requests][3]

Different companies have different routines for request handling and can use SuperOffice Service in different ways. Below we have set up two real-life scenarios showing some of the available options. These scenarios will show you how you can reply efficiently when a contact has submitted a request by email and when a contact calls in with a problem or a question.

### Scenario 1: The contact submits the request by email

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD034 -->

1. The contact receives [automatic acknowledgement][23] of receipt of the enquiry.

1. The request ends up with a request handler in SuperOffice CRM. See [Assign requests][6] and [Find requests][10].
1. The request handler reads through the request.
1. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on their own and does one of the following:
    * [Asks a colleague][7].
    * [Gets help from outside][8].
1. The request handler [sends a response to the contact][2].
1. The request handler [closes the request][3] and proceeds to deal with other requests.

### Scenario 2: The contact calls the request handler

1. The contact has a problem with a product and calls user-support.
1. The request handler who answers the call [registers the request][4].
1. The request handler is unable to fulfil the request on their own and does one of the following:
    * [Asks a colleague][7].
