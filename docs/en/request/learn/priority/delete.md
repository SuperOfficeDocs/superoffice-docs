# Delete request priority

You cannot delete priorities, but you can set the status of a priority to **Deleted**, to make it unavailable to users and customers.

> [!TIP]
> To show deleted/inactive priorities, click the **Show deleted items** check box below the list of priorities.

## How to delete a priority

1. Click the **Requests** button in the navigator and select the **Priorities** tab.

1. Click the required priority.

1. Click the **Deleted** check box.

1. Click **Save**. The priority will then no longer be available, for example, when users create new requests.
