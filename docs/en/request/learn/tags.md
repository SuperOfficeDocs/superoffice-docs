# Using tags in requests

Tagging is a powerful tool for organizing and finding requests in SuperOffice Service. You can create tags on the fly and tag any request with as many tags as you want. Using tags will simplify the way you search for, view and filter requests.

## Add/remove tags in multiple requests

When you [create or edit a request][1], you can add one or more tags that describe the request.

1. Select the relevant requests.
2. Click the **Actions** button (![icon][img1]) in the lower left corner of the request list.
3. Select **Batch management** and **Change**.
4. In the **Batch management** screen, select **Add tag**.
5. Click in the list and select a tag, or start typing in the field to search for a tag.
6. Repeat the previous step to add more tags.
7. Click **OK** when you are finished. The selected tags are added to the requests.

## Creating new tags

If you have the necessary functional right, you can also create new tags. In a tag field in a request or in the [quick search field][2], type a tag name you want to create. If the tag already exists, it will appear in the list. If not, click the message below the field to create the tag.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding and deleting tags is a functional right set by the administrator to facilitate a more efficient tag system, and to avoid duplicate tags for the same request. Administrators can also add tags in the **Tag** list in the **Lists** screen in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

## Searching for tags

Tags can be used to search for requests in the [quick search][2] and in the "regular" [search function][3] using criteria.
