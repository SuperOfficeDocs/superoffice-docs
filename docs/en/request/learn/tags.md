# Using tags in requests

Tagging is a powerful tool for organizing and finding requests in SuperOffice. You can create tags on the fly and tag any request with as many tags as you want. Using tags will simplify the way you search for, view, and filter requests.

Each company will want to use their own specific customer service request tags. Let us take a look at two types of tags that could be useful for you company:

* You can set up tags for the different customer stages your company uses such as, for example, Free trial, Onboarding, Existing, or Terminating.

* You can create tags related to the department that should handle a specific type of request such as, for example, Finance, Marketing or Sales.

By default, there are no tags present in your SuperOffice CRM solution. You can add as many new tags as you like, and tags that become redundant can always be removed or changed.

## Add/remove tags in multiple requests

When you [create or edit a request][1], you can add one or more tags that describe the request.

1. Select the relevant requests.
1. Click the <i class="ph ph-list" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Task** button in the lower left corner of the request list.
1. Select **Bulk update**.
1. In the **Bulk update** screen, check the **Tags** box.
1. Select **Add items** in the **Action** list and select the tags you want from the **New value** list.
1. Click **Update** when you are finished. The selected tags are added to the requests.

## Creating new tags

If you have the necessary functional right, you can also create new tags. In a tag field in a request or in the search field, type a tag name you want to create. If the tag already exists, it will appear in the list. If not, click the message below the field to create the tag.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding and deleting tags is a functional right set by the administrator to facilitate a more efficient tag system, and to avoid duplicate tags for the same request. Administrators can also [add tags][4] in the **Tag** list in the Lists screen in Settings and maintenance.

## Searching for tags

Tags can be used to search for requests in the [free-text search][2] and in the regular search function using criteria.
