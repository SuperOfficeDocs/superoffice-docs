# Request type

All requests that are registered in SuperOffice have a type. The default type is "Request". To view, add, update, and delete request types go to **Settings and maintenance**.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires a Service Premium user plan (to create and update request types) and a Development Tools site license to define screen layouts based on request types in the Screen Designer.

## Why use request types?

The main benefit of request types is efficient support. A specific request type targets a set of attributes needed for a specific process.

## Example

The finance team utilizes requests to manage incoming invoice claims, necessitating the visibility of the invoice number as a designated field. Conversely, the inbound sales team employs requests to address incoming leads. In instances where a request pertains to a lead, the invoice number holds no relevance and should remain entirely omitted from view.

## Where can I find the request types?

* In **Settings and maintenance**, select **Requests** in the navigator and then the **Request types** tab.
