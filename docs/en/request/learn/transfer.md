# Ask another request handler for help

As a request handler, you are not always able to answer the request on your own. You may sometimes need to ask for help from a colleague.

## Steps

1. [Open the request][1].

1. Select the person you want help from in the **Owner** list box from the **Request properties** sidebar. This means that you are transferring responsibility for the request to that person.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not know who should have responsibility for the request, you can select **(Automatically assigned)** in the **Owner** field and select the relevant [category][3] in the **Category** field. If, for example, the request relates to a payment question, you can change the category to "Invoicing". The request will then be automatically assigned to a request handler in the invoicing department in accordance with the applicable assignment rules.

1. Select the **Messages** tab.

1. Click **Add comment**.

1. Enter the question you want to ask the other person.

1. Set **Access level for message** to **Internal**, so the message is not visible in the Customer Centre.

1. Click **Save** and the new owner will see your internal comment.

> [!TIP]
> Before transferring responsibility for the request to someone else, it is a good idea to [add it to your favorites list][2], to remind yourself to follow it up. It will no longer be displayed under **Own open requests** when someone else is defined in the **Owner** field.
