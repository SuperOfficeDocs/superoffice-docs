# Categories

All requests belong to a category, and each category has its own rules that define how requests are processed in the system.

Typically, the higher-level categories will correspond to the organization's departments, while subcategories will correspond to areas of responsibility and/or logical structures within a department. Subcategories could also be the products that the company sells.

For example, main categories for User Support, Development, Sales and Invoicing - and subcategories in these for each of the products that are sold.

> [!NOTE]
> The term **category** is also used for company categories. See [Lists][3].

Users can be added as members in the categories individually or via the user groups they belong to.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a more flexible way of organizing your request? Try [using tags in requests][1].
