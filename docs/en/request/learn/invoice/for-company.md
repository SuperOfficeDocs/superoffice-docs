# View invoice data for companies

When processing requests, you have the option of [registering invoice data][1] as you proceed. When the request is closed, the customer can be invoiced for the work performed.

> [!NOTE]
> The invoice feature is only available if you have registered [invoice types][2] and have the required feature toggle.

**Steps:**

1. Open the **Company** screen.

2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Actions** button and select **Invoices**. The **Invoices for ...** screen appears. This contains both requests that include messages with invoiceable hours, and registered invoice items, in chronological order. Note in particular these columns:
    * **Credit**: Shows the total amount for invoicing.
    * **Debit** Shows the total amount invoiced.
    * **Balance**: Shows the running balance (the difference between **Credit** and **Debit**).

3. If you are sending an invoice out to the company, it is easier to keep an overview in SuperOffice Service if you add an invoice item at the same time.
