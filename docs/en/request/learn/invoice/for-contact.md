# View invoice data for contacts

When processing requests, you have the option of registering [invoice data][1] as you proceed. When the request is closed, the customer can be invoiced for the work performed.

> [!NOTE]
> The invoice feature is only available if you have registered [invoice types][2] and have the required feature toggle.

**Steps:**

1. Open the **Contact** screen.

2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Actions** button and select **Invoices**. The **Invoices for ...** screen appears. This contains both requests that include messages with invoiceable hours, and registered invoice items, in chronological order. Note in particular these columns:
    * **Credit**: Shows the total amount for invoicing.
    * **Debit** Shows the total amount invoiced.
    * **Balance**: Shows the running balance (the difference between **Credit** and **Debit**).

3. If you are sending an invoice out to the contact, it is easier to keep an overview in SuperOffice Service if you add an invoice item at the same time.

4. Click **Return to contact** to go back to the **Contact** screen.
