# Efficient handling of requests using AI

> [!NOTE]

The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in SuperOffice 10 gives request handlers / support agents a new set of smart tools to make their workday more efficient.

## Language detection

This functionality automatically detects the language of an incoming request. The detected language is displayed under the message.

## Translation

If you receive a message in a language you cannot read, you can click the **Translate from** ***language*** below the message. The subject and body of the message is translated and added below the original message.

## Sentiment analysis

Is the contact happy or angry?

* Negative ![icon][img2]
* Neutral ![icon][img3]
* Positive ![icon][img4]

If this function is active, incoming email requests are analysed to determine the mood of the contact. An emoticon below the message indicates the detected sentiment (happy, unhappy, or neutral).

### Automatic categorisation

Save time by letting the system categorise requests for you. If this function is active, incoming email requests are analysed to determine the best category for each request. The footer of a request shows the category suggested by the system. Click the category link to update the request with the suggested category.
