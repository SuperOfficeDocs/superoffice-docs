> [!TIP]
> Set the *No. of expanded messages* preference (under <i class="ph ph-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Request**) to control how many messages are shown when viewing a request.

## Reply to a request

1. Click <i class="ph ph-arrow-bend-up-left" aria-label="Reply"></i> or <i class="ph ph-arrow-bend-double-up-left" aria-label="Reply all"></i>.
    * Alternatively, click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **Reply** or **Reply all**.

1. The contact is automatically added as a recipient in the **To** field. You can add or remove recipients as needed.

1. Choose a template from the list. Hover over it to preview before inserting.

## Add a message to multiple requests

You can reply to several requests simultaneously, for example, if multiple inquiries relate to the same issue.

1. Select the requests you want to reply to:
    * Use a **saved selection** in the Selection screen.
    * Use the **Find requests** screen results.

1. Click the **Task** button and choose **Reply to customers**.

1. In the **Reply to customers** dialog:

    * **Close request:** Check this box to close the requests after sending the message.
    * Add your message in the text area. Use [reply templates][8] to save time.

    The message you enter will be added to the selected requests and sent by email to the contacts linked to the selected external requests.

1. Click **Reply** to send the message.

## Add a comment

Comments allow you to add internal notes to a request without sending them to the customer. For example, to include what you have done or discovered so far.

1. [Open the request][1].
1. Click<i class="ph ph-chat-text" aria-hidden="Comment"></i> above the message thread.
1. Add your comment in the text field.
    * Select **Internal** in the toolbar to ensure the comment is visible only to your colleagues.
1. Click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> Use comments to provide context when [transferring requests][10] to colleagues.

When you reply to a request, you can track the time spent on the response.

1. In the toolbar at the bottom of the **Message** tab, check the timer:
    * Click <i class="ph ph-play" aria-label="Play"></i> to start tracking time.
    * Click <i class="ph ph-pause" aria-label="Pause"></i> to stop the timer.
1. Edit the time manually if needed.
1. Save the request to log the time spent.
