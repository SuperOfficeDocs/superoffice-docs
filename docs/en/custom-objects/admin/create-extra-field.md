# Add extra fields

After you create an [extra table][1], you must set up fields in the table, to allow you to subsequently input data (entries). You can also create extra fields in standard tables.

## Steps

1. [!include[Go to tables](includes/goto-tables.md)]

1. Browse to your desired table, point at the table name, and click **New field**.

1. Select a type for the new field and click **OK**.

1. In the **Field properties** screen, enter data about the new field.

    * Enter a *name* to be used as the label.
    * Enter a *database field* beginning with **x_** to identify the field in the schema.
    * Optionally set other properties. The type (specified in step 3) determines what is available. Se details about the fields below.

    > [!TIP]
    > To make a field mandatory, select **Cannot be empty**.

1. Click **OK** to save the new field (runs `alter table y_mynewtable add column x_mynewfield ...`).

1. Continue adding more fields.

1. Click **Restart NetServer** when you are done. If Travel is activated, you will also see a message that a new Travel database must be generated.

## Field properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| Cannot be empty | Makes it mandatory to fill in this field. |
| Choose from list box | If the field is connected to an extra table, select this option to display a list of table values. |
| Choose values from list | If checked, the field turns into a list box. The list options are the text strings inputted in the text box, with one option per line. |
| Create index | If selected, it is possible to search by this field. It is quicker to search for data in indexed fields. |
| Database field | The column's name in the database must be unique within the table. It should be a single word, containing only underscores, letters (a-z), or numbers, and must start with "x_". This can only be set during creation and and **cannot be changed**. |
| Decimal places | The number of decimal places that are allowed in a number. |
| Default value | The value to be inserted by default in this field. |
| Description | The default description. |
| Display value | Whether to display the field's value. |
| External | If checked, the field is available from a customer centre. Relevant only for standard tables (extra tables are always displayed in customer centres). |
| Header for list | A header for these entries when they are displayed as "sub-entries" in a list. |
| Hide function buttons | (relations) Select this option to hide the function for adding new entries to relation tables. |
| Hide the field | Whether to display the field. |
| Keep HTML tags | (text) Select this option to include the HTML tag in the text. |
| Name | The name of the field. |
| Number of units | (time span) The maximum number of units for the "largest" selected time unit. Example: If you selected hours and minutes, and enter "4", a maximum of 4 hours can be selected, while minutes go to 60. Similarly for days and hours, a maximum of 4 days can be selected, while hours go to 24. |
| Only allow leaf nodes for hierarchical list boxes | (extra table relation) Specify if only the lowest node in a hierarchy can be selected by the user. |
| Position | Specifies this field's position among the other fields in lists. |
| Search operator | Which search operator to use for this field. |
| Show in table | If checked, this field is displayed as a column in screens where several entries are displayed in a table. |
| Show one-to-many relations | If you selected the **Contact relation**, **Company relation** or **Request relation** field types and want to display a tab containing data from this table in the contact, company, or request screens, you can check this field. |
| Table | The table this field belongs to. |
| Target table | Which table to use. |
| Text area / Height | The number of lines of the text field. |
| Type | Displays the field type you selected. |
| Update null values now | Check this option to replace all null values (empty fields) in the database with the default value. **This operation can take a while.** |
| URL | The URL of the dynamic link here. |
| Use active user as default value | If checked, the field's value is by default set to the current user. |
| Use current date/time as default value | If checked, the field's value is by default set to the current date/time. |
| Use days / Use hours / Use minutes | The time unit for the time span field. |
| Use default value | If checked, the field is assigned a default value unless otherwise specified. |
| View in relational choosers | If the current table has a relation with another table (extra table relation), select this option to make this field available as a search field. Example: You created an extra table called "Products" with an extra table relation to the **Requests** table. In this way you can search for and add products in the **Extra fields** tab when creating new requests. By selecting **View in relational choosers** for specific fields in the "Products" table, these fields are available as search fields in the **Extra fields** tab. |

## Add relation (foreign key, FK)

1. Click **New field**.
1. Select the relation type for the entity you want to connect to and click **OK**.
1. Set field properties as described above.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Available from version 10.3.4 in pilot: Selecting **Show one-to-many relations** adds a section tab (archive) to related standard entities.

1. Click **OK** to save the relation.
1. Click **Restart NetServer** to apply the changes.

For example, to connect all incoming requests to a specific sale, you can add an extra field of type sale relation to requests ([ticket table][4]). To list connected requests when viewing a sale in SuperOffice CRM, you will need to build a web panel.
