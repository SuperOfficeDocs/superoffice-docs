# Tables screen

[!include[Requirement](../../../learn/includes/req-expander-services.md)]

In the Tables screen in **System design**, there is a list of the database tables in SuperOffice. Here you can create new tables and fields for different screens.

> [!TIP]
> Extra fields can for instance be used as search criteria and columns in sales.

This screen displays both standard tables (predefined in the system and form the basis of different screens) and extra tables (tables you create yourself with optional content).

> [!NOTE]
> If your company uses SuperOffice CRM, you will see a message that NetServer must be restarted every time you add new fields or tables. If Travel is activated, you will also see a message that a new Travel database must be generated.

## Where to find the screen
