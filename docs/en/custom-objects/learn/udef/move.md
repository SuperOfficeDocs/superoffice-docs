# Place fields

> [!NOTE]
> SuperOffice version 10 (released October 2021) introduced [Screen designer][1] with customizable screen layouts for specific user groups. Any custom screen layouts using screen designer may override the settings described below.

When you add new fields, they are placed beneath each other by default. Each field consists of a label with a data field on the right. You can decide where in the grid these fields are to be placed.

## How do I move fields?

* Click and drag using the mouse. The fields will automatically be adjusted to fit the grid.
* Click a field and use the arrow keys on the keyboard.
* Click a field and use the arrow keys in the bottom-right corner ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ![icon][img4] ![icon][img3] ).
* Double-click a field and specify position values **X** and **Y** in the **Fields** dialog.

## How do I set position?

1. Specify the following in the fields to the right of **Label**:

    **X**: horizontal position of the label. The higher the number, the further to the right.

    **Y**: vertical position of the label. The higher the number, the further down.

2. Specify the following in the fields to the right of **Data**:

    **X**: horizontal position of the data field. The higher the number, the further to the right.

    **Y**: vertical position of the data field. The higher the number, the further down.

## How do I select fields?

* Click a field in the grid to select it.
* Click and drag in the grid to select several fields.
* Click a field in the **Fields** list to select both the label and the data field in the grid.

## How do I right-/left-align fields?

Select the fields you want to adjust and click left-align ( ![icon][img5] ) or right-align ( ![icon][img6] ) below the grid.

## How do I change the width of a field?

1. Double-click the relevant field in the **Fields** list or grid
2. Specify the width of the label in the field to the right of **Label**.
3. Specify the width of the data field in the field to the right of **Data**.
