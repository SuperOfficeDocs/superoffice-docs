# User contexts

Applications can have 2 different types of interaction with tenant installations: interactive user sessions; non-interactive background services.

SuperOffice CRM Online supports both types of interactions. The first as an **application user** context and the second as a **system user** context.

## Application user (interactive)

This is the typical case when a **person** is signed in to SuperOffice CRM Online.

**Requirements:**

* Application is interactive/reactive
* Application has UI in SuperOffice
* Users have their own sign-in credentials
* Users have their own options

Applications are **not allowed to directly ask users for their credentials**, and therefore must use SuperOffice [federated authentication][1] to sign SuperOffice CRM Online users into their applications.

## System user (non-interactive)

All applications that run as background tasks, without user interaction, must receive a [system user token][2] and use the [system-user flow][2] for interacting with our web services. None of the [OpenID Connect flows][4] are supported.

The system user has unlimited access to the [tenant][6] and is not restricted by functional rights or data rights.

**Requirements:**

* The application runs in the background
* The application must bypass the sentry
* No UI elements in SuperOffice
* Runs as a service

See also [application models terminology][6] and the [system user MVC example][7].
