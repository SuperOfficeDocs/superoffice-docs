# Submit standard app for certification

Your standard application is almost ready. Before we go live, we need to ensure that it can be safely distributed via the SuperOffice App Store andÂ that you have given thought to the cybersecurity of your company and the information security of your application.

## Pre-requisites

* You have gone through the [certification checklist][1].
* You have appointed a designated certification contact who will be available during the test period.

## Certify

1. [Request to publish configuration in the Developer Portal][2].
2. Provide additional info and clarify questions while we run certification tests in SOD and Stage.

    [!include[List of info](../includes/list-of-test-period-info.md)]

3. [Pass Watchcom security test][3].
4. Fix issues if necessary.

After certification, your application is ready to be published in the App Store!

**Next step:** [publish application in CRM Online][4] environment.
