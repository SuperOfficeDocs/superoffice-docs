# The App Store marketplace

[!include[ALT](../includes/def-app-store.md)]

Customers can browse the store to find a range of applications made available from both SuperOffice and our partners.

## Open to all SuperOffice CRM Online customers

The SuperOffice App Store is transparent and open to any applications that represent a clear business value to your customers and users, SuperOffice, and partners.

* Anonymous users may browse the marketplace (without login)
* Signed-in users can view their purchased and installed applications
* Signed-in users must have an active subscription to SuperOffice CRM Online to buy an application

### Marketplace, not a webshop

SuperOffice will not bill, [provision][1], or host partner applications. Instead, the App Store redirects to our partners' websites where customers buy directly from the partner.

## Partner profile pages

Each vendor that chooses to publish one or more standard applications to the App Store gets a **partner profile page**. For an example, see [SuperOffice AS in the App Store][2].

On this page, visitors learn more about who developed the application, and they can visit the partner's website for more information.

The page also lists all applications by this vendor with links to pages with details for each application.

## App detail pages

This page shows all the application's details. At the top, visitors can see the application name, the green **Install/Sign-up** button, and a one-line header introducing the app.

* A general description
* Pricing
* The terms
* How to install
* What is new

> [!NOTE]
> This price will show only under an application's home page image, and only if it is not marked as free.

Visitors can also see the category and language of the application and find out how to get support.

### Market availability

All SuperOffice customers can visit the App Store. There are no geographical limitations when viewing Apps. However, it could be that an application is not suitable for specific markets. For example, BankID for proving identity doesn't work in the Benelux.
