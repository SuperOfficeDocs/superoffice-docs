# Revoke access given to an app

Revoking access to an application is a manual procedure. It will sever the connection between the application and a database tenant. It will not remove any data from the database.

The revocation must be done by the customer's tenant administrator.

1. Sign in to the [App Store][1].
2. Locate the application you want to revoke access to.
3. Click **Report a problem** and tell us that you no longer want this application to have access to your tenant.
4. If provided, use the application's **Uninstall** to remove the configuration (such as user-defined fields and web panels).
