# Chat administration

The **Chat** feature in SuperOffice allows your support agents and sales people to chat with customers, potential customers and other people via the chat widget/window on your website. This feature can for instance be used for service/support and pre-sales, and it easily integrates with FAQ, documents/attachments and templates. The chat feature can be set up with multiple chat channels for different topics, such as technical support, product questions and sales support.

Your agents can access chat via the Navigator in SuperOffice.

## Chatbot connector

Chatbots are made to simulate conversations and often used to help customers visiting your website with support questions, collecting more information, suggest products, or even help customers in tasks like pay a bill or make a reservation. The applications are many and growing, and whilst the benefits can be many, it is by nature one of the more complex applications of AI technologies. AI tries to get machines to learn the complexities of human language, but there are still some challenges in conversing with unpredictable humans.

We have created a chatbot connector that allows SuperOffice to talk to your bot service of choice. By using data from the bot service, the chatbot will be able to predict the next question and provide additional information the customer may need. If necessary you could always direct your customer to a live chat agent or offer help via the request handling system in SuperOffice.

There are different options available in the chat channel to activate the chatbot.
