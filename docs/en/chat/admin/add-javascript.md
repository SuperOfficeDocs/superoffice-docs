# Add JavaScript for your website

To make the chat feature available to your customers, you must add a JavaScript to the relevant pages on your website. If you have set up multiple chat channels, each chat channel has a specific JavaScript that must be added to the relevant page(s).

Now that you have [configured the chat widget][1], this step will show you how to add it to your website.

## Steps

1. [!include[Go to](../../learn/includes/goto-sm.md)]
1. Select <i class="ph ph-chat-teardrop-text" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Chat** in the Navigator.
1. Select a chat channel in the list and click **View**. The JavaScript for the selected chat channel is displayed.
1. Select and copy the script.
1. Log in to the editor page of your website.
1. Go to the section where you can edit or add HTML code.
1. Paste the JavaScript for your chat widget into the code of your web page.
1. Save, upgrade or publish the changes (this depends on what system you use).
1. Open or refresh your web page.

The chat widget is now available and live. Visitors to your website may start chatting with you.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable the chat feature, your organization must be ready to handle all incoming chat conversations.
>
> The *DEFER* parameter ensures that this script does not block page loading. The script will run after the page finish loading.
