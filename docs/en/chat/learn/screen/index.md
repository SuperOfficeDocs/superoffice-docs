# Chat screen

The **Chat** screen consists of the following tabs:

* **Dashboard**: Displays statistics for all or selected chat channels. Incoming chats and ongoing chat sessions are listed here.
* **Chats**: Where the agent chats with customers.

## The Dashboard tab

In the **Dashboard** tab you can view chat statistics, respond to incoming chats, and listen to ongoing chats (if you have this permission). The number in the **Dashboard** tab indicates how many incoming chats have not been answered by an agent.

## The Chats tab

Use the **Chats** tab to respond to incoming chats from customers.

![The Chats tab -screenshot][img5] The number in the **Chats** tab indicates the number of chats you are currently handling.

The **Chats** tab has three main areas:

* List of active/recent chat sessions (left side)
* Chat conversation (middle)
* Contact side panel (right side), showing customer information

### List of active/recent chat sessions

This list contains

* Ongoing chats
* Recently completed chats (last 8 hours)

The number of chats in queue is also listed here, and you can click **Get next in queue** to respond to the next chat in the queue.

The following icons are used for the active chat sessions in the list:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon][img2] | The last message in the conversation from the customer and agent. |
| ![icon][img3] | Number of unread messages from the customer. |
| <i class="ph ph-warning-circle" aria-label="Warning"></i> | Transferred chat to you or from you. Waiting to be accepted. |

### Chat conversation

Here you can [chat with the customer][6].

Actions:

* [Create request in chat][1]
* [Transfer a chat to another agent][2]
* [Send FAQs, reply templates and quick replies in a chat][3]
* [Send files in chat][4]
* [Create a quick reply][5]

### Contact side panel (right side)

When a customer contacts you in the chat and is already registered in SuperOffice, you can display relevant information about them in the side panel on the right side of the **Chat** screen. You can also add new customers as new contacts (and new companies).

Here you can match the customer in the chat with an existing contact in SuperOffice, or create a new contact and/or company.

If the customer is found in SuperOffice, you can show contact information, requests, sales, follow-ups and previously registered chat sessions.
