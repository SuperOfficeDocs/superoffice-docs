# Link chat to existing contact

When you respond to a chat, SuperOffice will automatically try to find the customer in SuperOffice based on the provided information (email address and name). If the customer is already registered as a contact in SuperOffice, you can display relevant information about them in the side panel on the right side of the **Chat** screen. Double-click a record to view it.

The chat session is also linked to the contact and available as a record in the **Activities** section tab in the Company screen and Contact screen.

## Use suggested contact

If SuperOffice finds matching contacts in the database, they are listed under **This contact could be...**. Click a contact to view relevant information and to link the contact to this chat session for future reference.

## Search for a contact

If you selected the wrong contact, you can click **Change contact** at the bottom of the side panel to search for another contact.

## Create a new company and contact

If a contact is not found in SuperOffice, you can create a new contact and company in the side panel.
