# Link chat to existing contact

When you respond to a chat, SuperOffice will automatically try to find the customer in SuperOffice based on the provided information (email address and name). If the customer is already registered as a contact in SuperOffice, you can display relevant information about them in the side panel on the right side of the **Chat** screen. Double-click a record to view it.

The chat session is also linked to the contact and available as a record in the **Activities** section tab in the Company screen and Contact screen.

First, you must link the customer to a contact in SuperOffice.

## Use suggested contact

If SuperOffice finds matching contacts in the database, they are listed under **This contact could be...**. Click a contact to view relevant information and to link the contact to this chat session for future reference.

## Search for a contact

If SuperOffice cannot find the correct contact in the database, you can search for the contact using the search field. Here you can also select from the history list and favorites.

## Change contact

If you selected the wrong contact, you can click **Change contact** at the bottom of the side panel to search for another contact.

## Create a new company and contact

If a customer is not found in the SuperOffice CRM database, you can [create a new contact and company][1] in the side panel.
