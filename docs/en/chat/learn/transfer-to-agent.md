# Transfer a chat to another agent

You can transfer chats to other agents and receive transferred chats from other agents.

> [!NOTE]
> A manager can also take over the chat or transfer the chat to another agent. This allows someone with administrator rights to make sure the customer gets an agent that is available and can help the customer correctly.

## How to transfer

1. Click ![icon][img1] and select **Transfer**.
2. Select an agent in the **Transfer to** list. Only agents with status **Present** are displayed here.
3. Click **Transfer**. The chat is highlighted in the sessions list. Now one of the following happens:
    * If the receiving agent accepts the transferred chat, you will enter listening mode. You can view the ongoing chat, but you cannot respond to messages. To close this chat session, click ![icon][img1] and select **Close window**.
    * If the receiving agent rejects the transferred chat, it will no longer show as highlighted in the sessions list. You can continue the chat or [create a request][1] to be handled by someone else.
    * If the receiving agent does not respond, click **Cancel transfer**. You can continue the chat or [create a request][1] to be handled by someone else.

> [!TIP]
> If you have the permission **Can listen in**, you can go to the **Dashboard** tab and double-click a chat session to view it.

## Accept a chat transferred from another agent

If an agent transfers a chat to you, the chat is automatically displayed in the chat panel and is highlighted in the sessions list.

1. (if relevant) Select the transferred chat in the sessions list to view it.
2. Click **Accept transfer** (below the chat conversation) to accept the chat. If you do not want to accept the chat, click **Reject transfer**.
