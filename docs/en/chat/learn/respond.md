# Respond to a chat

Incoming chats are indicated in the following ways:

* A number icon on the **Dashboard** tab shows how many incoming chats have not been answered by an agent.
* In the **Incoming chat** list in the **Dashboard** tab. Double-click a row to respond to a chat.
* In the **Chats** tab, the **In queue** field shows how many chats are waiting for a response.
* A warning appears if a chat is not answered within a specified amount of time. This warning is shown only if your status is **Present**.

## Setting your status (Present/Away)

Set your presence in the upper-right corner of the **Chat** screen.

* **Present:** You receive warnings for unanswered chats.
* **Away:** You do not receive warnings but can still respond to chats. If all agents are away, customers see the offline form when they start a chat.

## Respond to next chat in queue

1. Click **Chat** in the Navigator.

1. Ensure your status in the upper-right corner is set to **Present**.

1. Click **Get next in queue** to claim the next unanswered chat.

    To respond to a specific customer, go to the **Dashboard** tab, find the chat in the **Incoming chat** list, and double-click the row.

1. In the message field, type your response and press **ENTER** or click **Send** to chat.

    * To personalize your response, try to [locate the customer in SuperOffice][1]. This lets you view relevant information in the side panel.
    * To add emojis or stickers, click <i class="ph ph-smiley" aria-label="Smiley"></i> next to the text field.

1. To send additional information during the chat:
    * [Send an FAQ, a reply template, or quick reply][4]
    * [Send a file](#attach)

1. If you are unable to help the customer, do one of the following:
    * [Transfer the chat][2] to another agent.
    * [Create a request][3] from the chat.

1. When the conversation is over, click <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **End chat**, unless the customer closes the chat window first.
    The chat is moved to **Recent chat sessions**, and a record is also saved in the **Activities** section tab in SuperOffice CRM.

The file is sent immediately.

## Be efficient with chat replies

To make sure that you offer quick and professional answers to your customers' chat queries, SuperOffice Chat offers a number of options to speed up and improve your chat replies.

Save time by using pre-defined texts when answering customer queries through chat. You can create and send a quick reply to a commonly asked question. In other situations, where quick replies aren't sufficient, you can [include FAQs, customized reply templates][4], or files.
