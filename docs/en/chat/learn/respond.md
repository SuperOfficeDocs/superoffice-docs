# Respond to a chat

Incoming chats are announced in the following ways:

* ![icon][img2] A number icon on the **Dashboard** tab. The number indicates how many incoming chats have not been answered by an agent.
* In the **Incoming chat** list in the **Dashboard** tab. You can double-click a row to respond to a chat.
* In the **Chats** tab, the **In queue** field will show how many unanswered chats are in queue.
* A warning popup if a chat has not been answered within a specified amount of time. You will only see the warning if your status is **Present**.

## Setting your status (Present/Away)

In the top-right corner of the **Chat** screen, you can set your presence:

![icon][img3] You are listed as a present agent and will receive warnings of unanswered chats.

![icon][img4] You are not listed as a present agent and will not receive warnings of unanswered chats. However, you can still respond to incoming chats.

> [!NOTE]
> If all agents have status **Away**, the customer will only see the offline form when they start the chat.

## Respond to next chat in queue

1. Click **Chat** in the Navigator.

2. In the top-right corner, make sure your status is set to **Present**.

3. Click **Get next in queue** to respond to the next chat.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To respond to a specific chat (for instance from a returning customer), double-clicking the relevant row in the **Incoming chat** list in the **Dashboard** tab.

4. Try to [locate the customer in SuperOffice][1], so you can see relevant information about them in the side panel, to help you respond to their inquiry.

5. To chat, enter text in the lower part of the screen, and press **ENTER** or click **Send**.

6. To use emojis/stickers, click <i class="ph ph-smiley" aria-label="Smiley"></i> next to the text field.

7. If you are unable to help the customer with their question, do one of the following:

    * [Transfer the chat][2] to another agent.
    * [Create a request][3] from the chat.

8. To send the customer additional information:
    * [Send an FAQ, a reply template or quick reply][4], and/or
    * [Send a file][5]

9. When the conversation is over, you can click <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **End chat** (unless the customer closes the chat window first). The chat is moved to **Recent chat sessions**. You can also find a record of the chat in the **Activities** section tab in SuperOffice CRM.

> [!NOTE]
> If the post-chat form is active for this chat channel, the customer may return to the chat. The chat will be reactivated.

## Be efficient with chat replies

To make sure that you offer quick and professional answers to your customers' chat queries, SuperOffice Chat offers a number of options to speed up and improve your chat replies.

Save time by using pre-defined texts when answering customer queries through chat. You can create and send a quick reply to a commonly asked question. In other situations, where quick replies aren't sufficient, you can [include FAQs, customized reply templates][4], or [files][5].

![From the button for add predefined text, you can choose text from FAQ, Reply templates and Quick replies -screenshot][img6]
