# Create request in an active chat

If you cannot solve the issue via the chat, you can create a request to be handled by another specialist.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **Create request**.
2. In the dialog, fill in the relevant fields.
3. The chat log is added to the request, but you can add more information here if necessary.
4. Click **Save**.
5. A short message containing the request ID is added to the text field in the chat. Click **Send** to send this to the customer.
