# Create request in an active chat

If you cannot solve the issue via the chat, you can create a request to be handled by someone else.

1. Click ![icon][img1] and select **Create request**.
2. In the **Create request** dialog, fill in the relevant fields.
3. The chat log is added to the request, but you can add more information here if necessary.
4. Click **Save**.
5. A short message containing the request ID is added to the text field in the chat. Click **Send** to send this to the customer.
