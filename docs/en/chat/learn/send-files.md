# Send files in chat

You can send SuperOffice documents and other files to the customer.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-paperclip" aria-label="Attachments"></i> in the lower part of the chat panel.
2. To send a file, do one of the following:
    * Click **Select a CRM document**, and search for and select the SuperOffice document you want to send.
    * Click **Upload files (or drag and drop here)**, select the file and click **Open**.
    * Drag and drop a file from Windows Explorer to **Upload files (or drag and drop here)**. Make sure that **→Move** is displayed next to the mouse pointer when you drop the file (not **+ Copy**).

The file/document is immediately sent to the customer.
