# Merge companies

[!include[Requirement](../../learn/includes/note-req-manage-entities.md)]

You can merge duplicate database records of companies. Contacts and activities will be moved to the target company and the source company will be deleted.

**Steps:**

[!include[Go to company](../../learn/includes/goto-company.md)]

1. Select **Manage companies** from the ![icon][img3] **Task** button, and click **Merge companies**.
    The **Merge companies** dialog opens. The source company is specified under **From**.

1. Under **To company**, select the company you want to update with information from the source company. Start typing in the field to [search for a company][1].

    > [!TIP]
    > To switch the **From** and **To** companies, click the ![icon][img1] button.

1. Under **Contacts and company details**, you can choose from:

    * Merge identical contacts. If selected, contacts with identical names are merged.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The names must be EXACTLY the same, first name, middle name and last name, to be merged.

    * **Replace empty fields in \[target company\] with values from \[source company\]**. If selected, empty data fields in the **To** company are updated with data from the **From** company.

    [!include[Preview results](../../learn/includes/note-preview-results.md)]

1. Click **Merge**. The following then happens:

    * The companies are merged.
    * Contacts are moved or merged.
    * All activities are moved.
    * Project memberships and memberships of static selections follow the company.
    * All details are merged if you selected **Replace empty fields in &lt;target company&gt; with values from &lt;source company&gt;**.
    * The source company is deleted.
