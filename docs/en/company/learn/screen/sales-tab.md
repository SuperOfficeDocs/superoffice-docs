[!include[Conf. columns](../../../learn/includes/tip-configure-columns.md)]

Double-click a sale in the list to open the Sale screen with information about that sale.

Click **Add** to create a new sale.

Click the **Filter** button ![icon][img2] to [filter the list][4] by date, users or groups.

If you check **Include stakeholders** at the bottom of the section tab, sales where the company is involved as a [stakeholder][3] are also displayed.
