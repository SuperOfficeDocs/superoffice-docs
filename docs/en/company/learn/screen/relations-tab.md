# Relations tab

![Relations (Company screen) -screenshot][img2]

The **Relations** section tab displays any connections existing between companies and/or contacts, for example, information about ownership structure or about people who have been employed in different companies.

## <a id="columns"></a>Columns in Relations tab

The columns of the **Relations** section tab contain the following information:

* Names of the companies (and any contacts) defined as parties to the relation.
* What relation they have to each other.
* If a paperclip symbol (![icon][img1]) is displayed, this indicates that there is a more detailed description of the relation in the **Relation** dialog.

Double-click on a relation row to open the **Relation** dialog, showing all the information entered for that relation.
