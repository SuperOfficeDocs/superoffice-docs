    Specify it either by clicking the arrow and selecting the required company in the displayed list box, by typing in the whole or the beginning of the company name.

1. Optionally, specify any contact in the **Contact** list box under **Active part**. For example, if a contact in Company A is a former colleague of a contact in Company B.

1. In the **Company** list box under **Passive part**, specify the company you want to define as the passive party in the relationship. Use the same procedure as under **Active part**.

1. In the **Contact** list box under **Passive part**, specify a contact for the passive party, if required. Use the same procedure as under **Active part**.

1. In the **Relation** list box, specify what relationship there is between the active and passive parties, "owns" for example. [!include[SM](../../learn/includes/are-defined-sm.md)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > The alternatives displayed in this list box also depend on if it is a relation between two companies, between a company and a contact, or between two contacts.

1. Enter any additional information as free text in the **Description** field. If you type in anything here, a ![icon][img1] paperclip symbol is displayed on the relevant line in the **Relations** section tab.

1. The **Result** field is automatically updated according to the information in the **Relation** field. Example: If you selected "owns" as a relationship, the result will show who owns whom, and who is owned by whom.

1. When you are done, click **Save** to close the dialog and save the information you entered.
