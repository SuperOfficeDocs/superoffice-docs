# Company

All information related to a company – be it your customer, partner or supplier – is stored on the Company card/screen. This card provides you with an instant snapshot of the company in one screen.

[!include[Intro](includes/company-screen-intro.md)]

In the **Company** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card, containing all information for that company.

To move between companies, click the previous/next buttons (![icon][img2] ![icon][img1]) at the bottom right of the cards.

You can search for specific companies based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new companies and contacts.
