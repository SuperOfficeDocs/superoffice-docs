# Company

The **Company screen** provides an instant snapshot of all information related to a company, such as customers, partners, or suppliers.

![The Company screen showing company details, the Contacts section tab, and the Company side panel. -screenshot][img3]

At the top, the **Company card** displays key details about the company, such as contact information, category, and main contact person. You can navigate between companies using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons (<i class="ph ph-caret-circle-left" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="ph ph-caret-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>) at the lower right of the card.

Below the card, the **section tabs** allow you to view additional information and manage related records, like contacts or activities.

The screen also lets you search for companies, create new records, manage contacts, write documents, and generate follow-ups.

> [!TIP]
> You can open the company's Internet home page from SuperOffice CRM by clicking the address specified in the **Website** field on the company or project card. The page is then opened in your default browser.
