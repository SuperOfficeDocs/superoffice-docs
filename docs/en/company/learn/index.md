# Company

All information related to a company – be it your customer, partner or supplier – is stored on the Company card/screen. This card provides you with an instant snapshot of the company in one screen.

![Company screen -screenshot][img3]

[!include[Intro](includes/company-screen-intro.md)]

In the **Company** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card, containing all information for that company.

To move between companies, click the previous/next buttons (![icon][img2] ![icon][img1]) at the bottom right of the cards.

You can search for specific companies based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new companies and contacts.

## Section tabs on Company

The bottom of the screen contains the following [default section tabs][18]:

| Section tab | Description |
|---|---|
| [Contacts][11] | Contains information about employees of the active company. |
| [Relations][12] | Displays any connections existing between companies and/or contacts. |
| [Activities][13] | Contains all the activities linked to the active company. |
| [Projects][14] | Shows all the projects for the active company. |
| [Sales][15] | Contains information about any sales connected to the company. |
| [Requests][16] | Shows SuperOffice Service requests for the active company. |
| [ERP][17] | Here you can link a SuperOffice company to a customer/supplier in the ERP system. |

> [!NOTE]
> [Contacts][1] that are not associated with a company, can be found in the Contact screen.
