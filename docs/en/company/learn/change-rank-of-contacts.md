# Change the rank of contacts

When you create a new contact, they appear at the bottom of the **Contacts** section tab for the active company (ranked lowest). However, you can change this rank. For example, to specify that the contact added last should be the main contact.

1. Make sure the list is sorted by ranking.

    <details><summary>How?</summary>

    On the far right of the list is a column with numerical values that show the ranking of the various contacts. If these are in ascending order, so that the contact at the top of the list is numbered 1 and the number increases down the list, they are sorted correctly.

    If you cannot see the number column, you must first [add the Rank column][1].

    If the numbers are in a different order, you can click the column heading immediately above to [sort the list][2] correctly.
    </details>

2. Select the required contact.
3. Right-click and choose **Shift Up/Shift Down** until the contact is in the desired position.

The changes you make here define the default ranking. They will not be reset the next time you click on the column heading.
