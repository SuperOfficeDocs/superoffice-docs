# Copy a company

[!include[Requirement](../../learn/includes/note-req-manage-entities.md)]

You can copy an existing company to create a new one. For example, if a company opens a new branch, you can reuse most of its information for the new record.

> [!NOTE]
> Activities, sales, interests, project membership, and selection membership are not copied.

## Steps

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) in the upper-right corner of the Company card.
    Select **Manage companies** > **Copy company** from the menu.
    The **Copy company** dialog appears, with the source company specified under **From**.

1. In the **To** section, enter the name of the new company. If needed, add a department.

1. Under **Copy contacts with all information**, choose one of the following options:

    * **Do not copy:** Only company details are copied.
    * **Copy:** Company details and associated contacts are copied.

1. Click **Copy**. The new company is created with its own number and code. If needed, you can [edit the company information][2] afterward.
