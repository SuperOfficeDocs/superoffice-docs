# Integration scenarios: Web client (onsite)

Available since 2007, the SuperOffice Web client has enjoyed a wide adoption by many on-site customer installations. The product has several advantages over the Windows client. For example, customers can install SuperOffice on a web server that is accessible both near and far without having to pay extra license fees for disconnected functionality such as Travel or incur the extra maintenance costs for maintaining Travel Gateway and the processing of *.up* and *.dwn* files.

SuperOffice CRM Web also enjoys many integration capabilities. I would go so far as to say that it is the most extensible CRM platform available today! With the ability to modify and adapt the user's experience, manipulate the data processing and logic, nearly every component in the SuperOffice CRM Web stack is over-ridable and extensible for complementary functionality or control.
