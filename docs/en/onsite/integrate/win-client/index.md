# Integration scenarios: Window client

A flagship CRM platform, the SuperOffice CRM client has been the leading SuperOffice CRM product since 1989. SuperOffice CRM was created to support the needs of the salesperson by making his everyday life easier â€“ and make it so user-friendly and elegant that the user would want to use it.

The Windows client exposes many hooks that make it easy for vendors to create a seamless experience with their applications. Integrations have full-duplex type communications, providing integrations the ability to receive notifications when users perform actions, immediately process the data concerned, and even switch the user's context and show important relevant information related to that action.
