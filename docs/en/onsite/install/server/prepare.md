# Prepare CRM Server computer for SuperOffice 11

1. Prepare the program files folder:

    We recommend to unzip the content of the **CrmServer.zip** file into *C:\Program Files\SuperOffice\CrmSetup* folder. Here you will find the tools for database maintenance and running scheduled tasks.

2. Prepare the document archive folder:

    This folder is the central document archive, and all users must have access to this location via the application.
