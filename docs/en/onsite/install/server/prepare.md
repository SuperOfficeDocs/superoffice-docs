# Prepare CRM Server computer for SuperOffice 11

1. Prepare the program files folder:

    *Program Files* is where the server software will be installed. By default, we put this in *C:\Program Files\SuperOffice\SuperOffice Server*. Here you will find the tools for database maintenance and running scheduled tasks.

2. Prepare the document archive folder:

    This folder is the central document archive, and all users must have access to this location via the application. For Win client users, this folder must be shared, the user must be able to create and edit folders and files.
