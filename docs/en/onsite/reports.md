# Reports in SuperOffice Win and Web

SuperOffice Win and Web use two different solutions for printing.

The SuperOffice Win client uses standard reports that can be altered through Reporter Studio.

The SuperOffice Web client does not use these definitions. The Web client only creates a hardcoded html page that is not possible to alter. This is done due to load and performance issues.
