# Security and deployment

## Intro

Here you will find articles to help you to securely deploy SuperOffice onsite for the Web client.

>[!CAUTION]
> To deploy the Win client, further security measures in addition to those covered here are recommended.

When installing SuperOffice onsite, you should consider:

* The different [deployment scenarios][1]
* Network and firewall configuration

We recognize that organizations have differing use cases and security requirements and that our advice may not suit everyone.

These recommendations may change over time as new security mechanisms are implemented or vulnerabilities in protocols and software surface.
