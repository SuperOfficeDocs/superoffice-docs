# Field mapping

Field mapping describes the relationship between the fields in the import file and the fields in the database. This relationship is reflected in the **Field mapping** table which consists of the following columns:

* **Field in file**: when you specify a file in the **Import file** field, the contents of the first record in the data file you are importing are inserted into this column.

* **Field in SuperOffice CRM**: shows which fields in the SuperOffice database the data in the **Field in file** column will be imported into.
