# ANSI files

ANSI is the character set used by Microsoft Windows. This means that the codes used for each character are specially tailored to Windows. In an ANSI file that is saved as a text file, the fields in records are usually tab separated. Each record is separated with a carriage return and line feed (CR/LF).

> [!TIP]
> You can open the data file you want to use for importing in any word-processing application before you import it, so that you can see which character separates the fields and the records in the file. Before you start importing, you must specify which characters are used as delimiters. You do this in the **Advanced options** dialog (see [Specify advanced import settings][1]).
