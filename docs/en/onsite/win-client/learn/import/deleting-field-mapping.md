1. The contents of the first record in the data file you are importing are displayed in the **Field in file** column under **Field mapping**, while the **Field in SuperOffice CRM** column shows which fields in the SuperOffice database this information will be imported into. Select the row you want to delete the field mapping for.

1. Click the **Clear** button. The contents of the **Field in SuperOffice CRM** column in the selected row will be cleared.

> You can also double-click a field to delete its field mapping. If you do that, a message box asks you to confirm the deletion.
