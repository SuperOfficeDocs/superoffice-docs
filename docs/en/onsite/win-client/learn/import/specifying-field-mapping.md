# Specify field mapping

1. [!include[How to open import](includes/open-import.md)]

[!include[Select file](includes/step-select-file.md)]

1. The contents of the first record in the import file are displayed in the **Field in file** column under **Field mapping**. Select a field you want to import into the database.

1. Click the **Map** button below **Field mapping**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively double-click the field you want to import.

1. The name of the current field in the import file is displayed in **Field in import file** in the **Map field** dialog. In the **Select field from table** list box, choose the type of data you want to import into the SuperOffice database, for example, companies.

1. In the **Name** table, all available fields for the data type you selected in the **Select field from table** list box are displayed, except those you have already mapped. Select a field to map.

1. Click **OK**. The information under **Field mapping** in the **Import** screen is updated.

    [!include[Save mapping](includes/tip-save-mapping.md)]

1. Repeat the procedure to map additional fields. You can import several different data types. Remember that fields not mapped with a record in the SuperOffice database will not be imported at all.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specified an import description file in the **Import description file** field, there may already be information in the **Field in SuperOffice CRM** column under **Field mapping**. If required, change the field mapping by [deleting field mapping][1] and then re-entering a new field mapping.
