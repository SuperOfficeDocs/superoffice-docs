# Import

[!include[Back up database before import](../../../../admin/import/learn/includes/caution-backup-before-import.md)]

The **Import** screen is where you incorporate important external data into the SuperOffice database from. For example, you could import a customer index so you can use it in SuperOffice CRM. More specifically, in the standard version of Windows Client settings, you can import the following data into the SuperOffice database:

* Companies with associated user-defined fields and interests
* Contacts with associated user-defined fields and interests
* Projects with associated user-defined fields
* Follow-ups
* Sales
* Products
* Currencies
* Post codes / ZIP codes
* Red-letter days

You can also [import companies/contacts and products in Settings and maintenance][9].

The fields in the **Import** screen and their use are described under [Import files][2]. Before you start importing, you should also read [Import routines][1]
