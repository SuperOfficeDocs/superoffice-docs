# Duplicates

A duplicate occurs if you have the same record in the import file and in the database. You must always specify rules for managing duplicates during an import in an [import description][1]. These rules will then be included in the import description when you save it. This applies to all data types. The **Handling of duplicates** table has the following columns:

* **Table**: shows which data type this duplicate handling rule applies to. The contents of this column are based on what you specified in the **Field in SuperOffice CRM** column under **Field mapping**.
* **Key**: shows an import key, the criteria that must be satisfied for a record to be considered a duplicate.
* **Action**: shows what happens if a duplicate is encountered.
