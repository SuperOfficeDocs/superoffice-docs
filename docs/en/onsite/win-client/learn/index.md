# Windows Client settings

Windows Client settings is the Windows-based administration client for SuperOffice CRM.

The majority of the administration features are available in [Settings and maintenance][3].

## Log in

Windows Client settings can be opened from the **Start** menu in Windows or directly from Windows Explorer.

You must belong to the **User level 0** role or another role that gives you login rights for Windows Client settings. User IDs, passwords and user levels are all defined in the Users screen in Settings and maintenance

The Windows Client login is required even if you are already logged in to SuperOffice CRM on the same PC.

## The main sections

## Buttons

The buttons in Windows Client settings activate their associated functions with a single click, making it easy to navigate quickly between the different parts of the program.
