# Freetext search and Travel

Freetext searching is usually available to all Travel users, but, if your organization uses Area Management, you can define that specific areas cannot use freetext searches. Without freetext searches, the SuperOffice database that Travel users take with them will take up considerably less space.

In the **Enable freetext for Travel areas** list, you can see which areas are defined and for which areas the freetext search function is available.

If you check **Automatically enable for new Areas** at the bottom of the window, all newly defined areas can access freetext search. To remove this access for an area, you must specify this using Area Management.
