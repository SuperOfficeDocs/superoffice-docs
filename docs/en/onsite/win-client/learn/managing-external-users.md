# Manage external users

If you are assigned the **Allow administration of external users** right in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can add and remove external users in SuperOffice CRM in connection with Audience or third-party applications. External users can also be administrated in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

## To open the External users dialog

1. Go to the company card for the company you want to manage external users for.

    There are several ways to open the **Company** screen:

    * By clicking the **Company** button in the Navigator.
    * By using the [history list][1] or [FastSearcher][2].
    * By double-clicking on a company in a search result or in a selection.

2. Click ![icon][img1] **Task** > **External users**. The **External users** dialog appears.

3. Follow one of the procedures below.

## Add an external user

1. Select the required contact in the list, and click **Edit**.
2. In the dialog which appears, enter the required user ID, password and role. You can also specify if the login should be enabled:
    * **Active login**: If the user has an active login, they are registered as an external user and can log in to the system.
    * **Inactive login**: If the user has an inactive login, they are registered as an external user but cannot log in to the system.
3. Click **Save** to save the settings and close the dialog, or **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving the settings.

## Remove an external user

Select in the list the contact you want to remove and click **Remove as external user**. The contact is then removed from the list of users.

## Remove login for an external user

Select the contact you want to remove the login for and click **Remove login**. The person will then remain as an external user, but the login is disabled and they cannot log in to the system.

## Filter the list

Using the **Show** list box at the bottom right of the dialog, you can filter the list of contacts according to user status.
