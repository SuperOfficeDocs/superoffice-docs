# RemoteTravel.ini

*RemoteTravel.ini* - config settings for SORT - remote travel client - used to copy up/dwn files and documents.

*RemoteTravel.ini* is the settings for the SuperOffice Remote Travel client, the tool that helps the travel user to copy up/dwn files, new and changed documents from the current travel user to the central database, and any changed documents from the central database to the travel user. Settings from the Communication dialog are stored in *%localappdata%\SuperOffice\RemoteTravel.ini*.

The file is automatically created when the client first clicks the Travel icon while checked out from the database.
