# Search for FAQ entries

If there are lots of FAQ entries in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea.

1. Go to <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **FAQ**.
2. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
3. Enter the text you want to search for and optionally other criteria.
4. Click **Search**.
5. When the search finishes, a list of all the records containing the text you entered in the **Search string** field is displayed. You can open a record by clicking it.

> [!TIP]
> Perhaps you should consider to [create a folder structure][2] to make it easier to locate relevant FAQ entries?
