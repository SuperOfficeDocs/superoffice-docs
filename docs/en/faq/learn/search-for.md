# Search for FAQ entries

If there are lots of FAQ entries in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea.

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **FAQ**.
2. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
3. [Search in SuperOffice Service][1].

> [!TIP]
> Perhaps you should consider to [create a folder structure][2] to make it easier to locate relevant FAQ entries?
