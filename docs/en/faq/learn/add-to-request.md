# Add FAQ entries to messages

When you respond to a customer enquiry, you can save time by inserting a link to an FAQ entry in your reply.

1. Go to the **Message** tab, as described under [Reply to customer][1].
2. Position the mouse pointer in the message where you want to insert the link.
3. Select the entry you want:
    * In the **Insert** field, click **FAQ entry** and then select an entry. Or,
    *Click **Text** ![icon][img1] in the toolbar ![icon][img3] , click the folder icon ![icon][img2], click **FAQ entry**, and then select an entry.
4. Click **Paste at cursor position**. A link is inserted. The customer can click it to show the relevant FAQ entry in the customer centre.

> [!TIP]
> You can also click **Preview** to display the selected item onscreen. If you select a message in the **Choose message** folder in the **Paste text** field and then click **Suggest FAQ**, a list of relevant FAQ entries for the selected message is displayed.
