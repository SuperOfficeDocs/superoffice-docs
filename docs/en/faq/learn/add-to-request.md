1. Position the mouse pointer in the message where you want to insert the link.
1. Click the ![icon][img4] list button, and select what to insert in the message.
    * In the **Insert** field, click **FAQ entry** and then select an entry. Or,
    * Click **Text** ![icon][img1] in the toolbar ![icon][img3] , click the folder icon ![icon][img2], click **FAQ entry**, and then select an entry.
