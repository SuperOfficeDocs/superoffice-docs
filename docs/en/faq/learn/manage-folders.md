# Administrate folders of FAQ entries

You can create a folder structure for FAQs, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place FAQ entries in any of these folders as appropriate. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

1. Go to <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **FAQ**.

1. Click the **New folder** button. This takes you to the **FAQ folder properties** screen.

1. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.

1. In the **Position** field, select a number for the entry's position in the sort order of the folder it belongs in. 1 means the top of the list.

1. In the **Folder** field, select a parent folder (if relevant).

1. In the **Access** field, select who is to have access to the folder in question.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A registered customer is a customer who has access to a customer centre.

1. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what the folder contains.

1. In the **Access control** field, you can enter a script to use to control external customers' access to this folder. If this field contains a script, it is evaluated and access granted only if the script returns a value of "1".

1. Click **OK**. The new folder is created. You are now ready to [add FAQ entries][3] to the new folder.

## Delete folders

Before you delete an FAQ folder, you must remove all the entries in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* You can [delete the FAQ entries][1].
* You can [move an FAQ entry to another folder][2] by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you edit an entry.
