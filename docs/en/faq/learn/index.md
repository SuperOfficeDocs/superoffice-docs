# Work with FAQ entries

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are an important part of service request handling. Since many customer inquiries repeat over time, it is a good idea to create FAQs that contain answers to such recurring questions.

## Advantages to having an FAQ library

* FAQs can be made available in your Customer Centre, where customers can search for answers themselves.
* FAQs speed up the work of support agents, who can quickly add links to FAQ entries when replying to customer inquiries.
* FAQs is a great way to send your customers precise and quality-assured answers.
