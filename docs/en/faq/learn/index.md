# Work with FAQ entries

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are an important part of service request handling. Since many customer inquiries repeat over time, it is a good idea to create FAQs that contain answers to such recurring questions.

[!include[Requirement](../../learn/includes/req-cep.md)]

## Advantages to having an FAQ library

* FAQs can be made available in your Customer Centre, where customers can search for answers themselves.
* FAQs speed up the work of support agents, who can quickly add links to FAQ entries when replying to customer inquiries.
* FAQs is a great way to send your customers precise and quality-assured answers.

## What is the difference between an FAQ entry and a reply template?

[!include[FAQ vs. reply template](../../learn/includes/faq-vs-reply-template.md)]

## View FAQ entries (in SuperOffice)

1. Go to <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **FAQ**. This takes you to the FAQ screen, which contains FAQ entries in a [folder structure][6] that you can create and edit yourself.

2. If the list contains several sub-folders, go to the one you require.

3. Click the FAQ entry you want. The **FAQ entry** screen appears and comprises two tabs:
    * **Overview**: Here you can see the question, answer and other details that make up the FAQ entry.
    * **Details**: Gives an overview of the user that created the FAQ, the workflow, who can see it, the keywords, number of times read and the score for the FAQ.
    * **Comments**: This contains any feedback that customers have added via the customer centre. In the list, you can view the comments and publish them (or not), if they are valuable additions to an FAQ entry.

To edit the current FAQ entry, click the **Edit entry** button.

To publish the current FAQ entry, select **Move forward in workflow**. To un-publish, select **Move backward in workflow**.

## Search for FAQ entries

If there are lots of FAQ entries in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea.

1. Go to <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **FAQ**.
2. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
3. Enter the text you want to search for and optionally other criteria.
4. Click **Search**.
5. When the search finishes, a list of all the records containing the text you entered in the **Search string** field is displayed. You can open a record by clicking it.
