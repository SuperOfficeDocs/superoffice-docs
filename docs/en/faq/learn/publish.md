# Publish FAQ entries

When a request handler [creates a suggestion for an FAQ entry][1], it is unpublished and unavailable in SuperOffice Customer Centre. To make it available, a person with FAQ administration rights must publish it.

1. When you log in, any unpublished FAQ entries are shown on the **Status** tile on the dashboard, under **Unpublished FAQ entries**.
1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Main menu** in the top bar and select **Knowledge base** > **FAQ**.
1. Click on the required entry.
1. In the **FAQ entry** screen, click **Edit entry**.
1. In the **FAQ entry properties** screen, select the **Question** and **Answer** tabs, and read through the question and answer.
1. If required, edit the question and answer to make them suitable for an FAQ entry and reusable.
1. If you have [multiple languages][4], you have to select the different **languages** in the footer and check the question and answer tabs.
1. Select the **Properties** tab.
1. Publish the FAQ entry by selecting **Published** in the **Workflow** field.
1. Make any other required changes in the **Properties** tab.
1. Click **OK**. The FAQ entry is now available for use.
