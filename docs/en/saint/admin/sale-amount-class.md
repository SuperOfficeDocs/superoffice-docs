# Add sale amount class

[!include[Must be admin](../../learn/includes/req-admin.md)]

The **Sale - Amount class** list is part of the activity monitor (SAINT) function, which requires a **Sales Premium** or **Service Premium** user plan.

An amount class for a sale can be used to categorize sales into different classes, for example, small, medium, large and very large. You specify the amount range for the different amount classes in the currency your organization uses (and additional currencies if required). Amount classes can be used to search for substantial lost sales during a period.

## Steps

1. Select <i class="ph ph-list-bullets" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Lists** in the Navigator.

1. Select **Sale - Amount class** from the dropdown menu. The **Items** tab displays all existing stages.

1. Click **Add** to open the **Edit list item** dialog.

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field. *(Mandatory)*

1. In the **Amount from** and **Amount to** fields, you can specify the range that will put the sale in this category.

    * The amount must be entered in the currency your organization uses.
    * The range of amounts may not overlap ranges in existing amount classes.

1. In the **Currency** list, select the currency your organization uses.

    * You can add multiple amount classes with other currencies if your organization requires this.

1. *(Optional)* Add a description in the **Description** field to clarify the purpose of the class.

1. Click **Save** to apply your changes or **Cancel** to discard them.
