# Select a default follow-up type for a status

## Why set up a default follow-up type?

When you come across a company (contact or project) with a status that requires your attention, you'd be able to click in the middle of the card and a new follow-up will open. This default follow-up could contain text that clearly states what you need to do with a company (contact or project) that has this specific status.

## Steps

You can specify a default follow-up type and descriptive text to be displayed in SuperOffice CRM when the user clicks **Create follow-up** in the status dialog.

1. Select the required status in the status list on the left of the screen.

1. Click the **Create follow-up** tab.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Chevron"></i> to the right of the **Type** field, and select a follow-up.

1. Enter the required description.
