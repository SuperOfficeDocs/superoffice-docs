* Select <i class="ph ph-subtract-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Selections** in the navigator, go to the **Task** tab and click **Create document mailing**.

* Select <i class="ph ph-target" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Marketing** in the navigator, select the **Mailings** tab and [create a new document mailing][1].

> [!NOTE]
