# Create document mailing to project members

To send the same document to all the members of a project, you can use the **Marketing** feature in SuperOffice. Do one of the following:

* Select <i class="ph ph-subtract-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Selections** in the navigator, click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> and select **Create document mailing**.

* Select <i class="ph ph-target" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Marketing** in the navigator, select the **Mailings** tab and [create a new document mailing][1].

> [!NOTE]
> In **Step 4: Recipients** you must select the project to add the project members as recipients.
