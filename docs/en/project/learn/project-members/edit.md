# Edit or delete project members

You can update the **Function** and **Comments** fields for project members, or remove multiple members at once.

## Edit project member info

1. Open the project (see [Use the Find screen][1]) and go to the **Project members** section tab.

1. Select one or more project members from the list, right-click, and choose **Edit**. This will open the **Add/edit project members** dialog.

1. In the **Add/edit project members** dialog, make the required changes:

   * **Function:** Update the function for the selected project members.
   * **Comments:** Edit the comments to provide additional details about the members' function in the project.

   > [!TIP]
   > You can select multiple project members (hold **Ctrl** or **Shift**). Any changes made in the **Function** or **Comments** fields will apply to all selected members.

1. Click **OK** to save your changes or **Cancel** to discard them.

## Remove project members

1. Select the project members you want to remove from the list in the **Project members** section tab.

1. Click **Remove** at the bottom of the section tab.

1. In the confirmation dialog that appears, click **Yes** to confirm the removal.
