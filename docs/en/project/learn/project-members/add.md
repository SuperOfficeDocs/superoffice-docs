# Add project members

To link a project to a company, at least one project member must be specified. You can do this on the Project screen or [via the section tabs](#from-section-tab) for contacts in the Company, Selection, or Sale screens.

When adding members to a project, you can assign functions individually as you add contacts/companies, assign functions afterward, or use a combination of both methods.

## Steps

1. Open the project (see [Use the Find screen][1]) and go to the **Project Members** section tab.

1. Click **Add** below the section tab. The **Add/edit project members** dialog opens.

1. Click the **Company/Contact** list to add members. You have several options:

    * Search: Type at least two characters to search for a contact or company.

    * History/Favorites: Select from the history list or favorites.

    * Company: Click ![icon][img3] to browse contacts by company or add a company as a member.

1. **Set functions**: Select a project member and assign a function. To assign the same function to multiple members at once, use **Select All** or hold Ctrl/Shift while selecting.

    Optionally, add a comment to describe the project member's function in more detail.

1. Click **OK**.

## <a id="from-section-tab"></a>Add project members and stakeholders from section tabs

You can add project members and stakeholders from the contact lists in different section tabs, for example **Company** (**Contacts**), **Selection** (**Company/Contact**), **Sale** (**Stakeholders**) and **Project** (**Project Members**). Thus procedure below can also be performed from the **Result** tab in the [Find screen][1].

**Steps:**

1. Go to the required section tab or the **Find** screen.

2. Select the required contact on the list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To add several contacts as stakeholders/project members, use **Shift** or **Ctrl** + click.

3. Right-click the contacts and select **Add to sale** or **Add to project** on the menu that appears.

4. In the **Sale** or **Project** field, specify which sale/project to add the contacts to. Do this either by clicking the arrow and selecting the required sale/project in the displayed list box, or by typing in the whole or the beginning of the sale/project name.

5. In the **Sales role** or **Function** field, specify the sales role/function each person has in the sale/project. Click the arrow to display a list of predefined alternatives to choose from.

6. Click **Save**.

## Troubleshooting

* **Missing person:** If a person is not listed, [create the contact][3] first.

* **Missing roles:** Available [functions][5] are defined in Settings and Maintenance.

## Tips

* **Add comments**

    If a comment is added, a ![icon][img1] paperclip will appear next to the **Project member information** column in the **Project Members** tab. Hover over the paperclip to see the comment tooltip.
