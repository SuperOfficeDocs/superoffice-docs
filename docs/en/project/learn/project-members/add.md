# Add project members

To link the project to a company, you must specify at least one project member.

## Project members

1. [!include[Go to project](../includes/goto-project.md)]

2. Choose the **Project Members** section tab.

3. Click the **Add** button below the section tab. The **Add project members** dialog opens.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also [add project members via the section tabs](#from-section-tab) containing contacts in the **Company**, **Selection** and **Sale** screens.

4. In the **Company/contact** field:
    * To select a contact from a company: Click the arrow and select the company you want in the list that appears, or type the name of the company. By default the company that is active in the **Company** screen is shown.
    * To select a contact directly: Type the name of the contact (this applies to both contacts with and without an associated company), and click the name in the results list.

5. In the **Project** field specify which project to add the project member(s) to by clicking the arrow and selecting the required project from the list.

6. In the list of contacts on the left select the contact(s) you want to add to the project.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the required name is not in the list, you must first [create the contact][2].

7. Click the arrow button to the right of the list ( ![icon][img2] ). The contact(s) will then be displayed on the right of the dialog.

8. In the **Function** field, specify the function each person has in the project. Click the arrow to display a list of predefined alternatives to choose from. These are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

9. In the large text box under **Comment**, enter a more detailed description of the person’s function within the project, if required.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enter anything in this text box, a paperclip symbol ( ![icon][img1] ) is displayed in the **Project member information** column in the **Project Members** section tab. Position the mouse pointer over the paperclip to display a tooltip containing the comment.

10. After entering the required information, click **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> You can select multiple contacts on the right side of the window by holding down **CTRL** or **SHIFT** as you select. Changes you then make in the **Function** field and **Comment** text box will apply to all the selected contacts.

## <a id="from-section-tab" />Add project members and stakeholders from section tabs

You can add project members and stakeholders from the contact lists in different section tabs, for example **Company** (**Contacts**), **Selection** (**Company/Contact**), **Sale** (**Stakeholders**) and **Project** (**Project Members**). Thus procedure below can also be performed from the **Result** tab in the [Find screen][3].

**Steps:**

1. Go to the required section tab or the **Find** screen.

2. Select the required contact on the list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To add several contacts as stakeholders/project members, use **Shift** or **Ctrl** + click.

3. Right-click the contacts and select **Add to sale** or **Add to project** on the menu which appears.

4. In the **Sale** or **Project** field, specify which sale/project to add the contacts to. Do this either by clicking the arrow and selecting the required sale/project in the displayed list box, or by typing in the whole or the beginning of the sale/project name.

5. In the **Sales role** or **Function** field, specify the sales role/function each person has in the sale/project. Click the arrow to display a list of predefined alternatives to choose from. These are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.
