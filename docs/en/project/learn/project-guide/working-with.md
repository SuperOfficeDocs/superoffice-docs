# Work with project guides

If a project guide is defined for a project type that you specify for a project, the following happens:

* The first status in the project guide is selected in the **Status** field on the main **Project** card.

* Follow-ups and/or documents for the status are listed on the **Project guide** section tab.

## Steps

1. Click the **Create** button in front of the follow-up/document name.

   ![Project guide section tab with overview of Planned status -screenshot][img1]

1. In the dialog that appears, you create the follow-up/document in the usual way. Many of the fields are prefilled, but you can change the information, or add more information. See [The Document dialog][1] or [The dialog for follow-ups][2].

    You can delegate the follow-up to your colleagues by setting them as the owner of the follow-up. If defined in Settings and maintenance for a specific follow-up, the **Assign task to project member** dialog appears, where you can select a colleague as the owner of the follow-up.

1. When you complete the follow-up, check **Completed** in the relevant dialog, or in the checkbox in front of the follow-up name on the **Project guide** section tab. By default, documents are marked as completed.

    > [!TIP]
    > To create several follow-ups of the same type, right-click the activity and select **Create another**. The [follow-ups dialog][2] opens.
    >
    > ![In the project guide tab you can right click and select Create another -screenshot][img2]

1. After all the required follow-ups and documents for a project status are completed, you move on to the next status.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you wish, you can go to the next status without creating or performing all the follow-ups/documents in a status.

1. Repeat the above procedure for all follow-ups/documents in each status of the project guide.

## Move to next status

You can move the project to the next status in two ways:

* To move the project to the next status automatically:

    It can be defined in Settings and maintenance that the project guide should propose moving the project on to the next status when the last follow-up in a status is marked as complete. The **Project guide - move the project to the next status** dialog then opens.

    Click **Yes** to move the project to the next status, or click **No** to continue working on the project within the same status.

* To move the project to the next status manually:

    Right-click the button for the next status in the **Project guide** section tab and select **Move to this status**.

    Or do one of the following on the main **Project** card:

    1. Click **Edit** on the main **Project** card.
    1. Click the arrow next to the **Status** field.
    1. Select the required status from the list that appears. [!include[SM](../../../learn/includes/are-defined-sm.md)]
    1. Click **Save**.

## Example

Keep in mind that your project guides may be configured differently in Settings and maintenance.

### Enter a new project and select a project type

You record a new project and select the **Conference** project type, which is linked to a project guide. The project guide contains the following statuses, follow-ups and documents.

| Statuses | Follow-ups | Documents |
|---|---|---|
| Planned | Planning meeting (Meeting (Internal)) | Conference programme (Memo) |
| In progress | Create list of project members (Follow-up) | conference (Meeting (External)) |
| Closing | Evaluation meeting (Meeting (Internal)) |
| Evaluation report (Memo) |

### The Planned status

1. You have agreed a meeting time and want to create the **Planning meeting** appointment in the Diary and invite participants.

    1. In the project guide, you click **Create** next to the **Planning meeting** follow-up.

    1. Click **Save**.

1. At the meeting you decide on the conference programme (agenda) and you want to create a memo containing this information.

        The **Document** dialog opens with **Memo** already selected as the document template, and the name of the project prefilled.
    1. Complete the rest of the information in the fields in the **Document** dialog.
    1. Click the **Create** button to create and save the memo.

1. After the meeting has taken place and the conference programme is ready, you want to confirm this in the project guide and move on to the next project status.
