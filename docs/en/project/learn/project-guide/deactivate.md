# Deactivate project guide

[!include[Must be admin](../../../learn/includes/req-admin.md)]

To remove a project guide from a project type, you can deactivate the project guide. You do this by unchecking **This project type is linked to a guide** for the project type in question (see [Add items to the Project - Type, status list][1]).

If you subsequently want to reuse the project guide, you simply check this option again. Any follow-ups and documents previously added to the project guide's statuses will be automatically retrieved. You can also add new follow-ups and/or documents, or delete those you do not want to use in this project guide.
