# View follow-ups and documents

By default, the follow-ups and documents for the current project status are displayed in the lower half of the section tab, but you can choose which follow-ups and documents you want to display, using the checkboxes at the bottom of the section tab.

## Show follow-ups and documents of one status

You can show the activities and documents for one of the statuses by clicking the button with the name of the status.

## Show all follow-ups and documents

Check **Show all statuses** to display all suggested and created follow-ups and documents for all statuses.

## Show only created follow-ups and documents

Check **Created only** to display only follow-ups and documents that have been created and hide suggested follow-ups and documents.

## Show only milestones

Check **Milestones only** to display only those follow-ups defined as milestones. A follow-up can be defined as a milestone in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

You can move the project to the next status using the **Status** list on the main card or by right-clicking the status button in the section tab and selecting **Move to this status**.
