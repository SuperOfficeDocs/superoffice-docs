# Project

You can link any activity to an external company and to a project. You can also work using a project guide that takes you through each step of the project, assuming that the project type you selected has a guide. A project can be targeted at many contacts, and a contact can participate in many projects.

Projects help you keep your work organized and documented in one place, so that you and your team can enjoy better control and improve collaboration.

You can connect any contacts, companies, follow-ups, project members, and even sales opportunities into one project in SuperOffice CRM. You can also create or upload documents and files to the project.

All the information you save inside your project is tagged with a date and an owner, making it easier to sort and filter information when need.

The Project screen contains information about the projects entered into SuperOffice CRM. Each project is displayed like an index card, showing all information about that project.

To move backwards and forwards between projects, click <i class="ph ph-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="ph ph-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> at the lower right of the cards

If you select a project type for which a [project guide][1] is defined, the **Project guide** tab is displayed on the section tab.

## <a id="more-tab"></a>The More tab for projects

The [More tab][12] includes additional custom fields for the project. Up to three fields from the **More** tab can also be shown in the main **Project** tab for easier visibility.

## <a id="section-tabs"></a>Project screen section tabs

The lower part of the Project screen consists of section tabs.

* [Project guide][13] (if one is defined for the current project type)
* [Project members][6]
* [Activities][16]
* [Sales][17]
* [Requests][18]

### Project guide

The project guide that can be customized to match your own unique project processes. You can map all the activities, documents and milestones of a project, which will make it easy for your whole team to track. The project guide will also help you monitor the current project status and prompt what needs to be done at all times.
