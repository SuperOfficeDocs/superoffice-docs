# Project screen

The **Project** screen contains information about the projects entered into SuperOffice CRM. Each project is displayed like an index card, showing all information about that project.

To move backwards and forwards between projects, click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the cards

If you select a project type for which a [project guide][1] is defined, the **Project guide** tab is displayed on the section tab.
