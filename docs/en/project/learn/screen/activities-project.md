# Activities

![Project guide activities section -screenshot][img1]

The **Activities** section tab shows all [activities][1] that are linked to the active project: follow-ups (meetings, to-dos, calls) and documents (including merge documents, reports and email).

Double-click an activity in the section tab to view or edit it, as required.

## Columns in the Activities section tab

### Completed status ![icon][img3]
