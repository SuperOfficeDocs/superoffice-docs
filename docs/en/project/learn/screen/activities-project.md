# Activities

![Project guide activities section -screenshot][img1]

The **Activities** section tab shows all [activities][1] that are linked to the active project: follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls) and documents (including merge documents, reports and email).

Double-click an activity in the section tab to view or edit it, as required.

## Columns in the Activities section tab

### Completed status ![icon][img3]

The first column in the **Activities** section tab indicates the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick in the checkbox ![icon][img2] means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.

### Type icons

The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a clock for an appointment and a telephone for a call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.
