# Project guide

In the **Project guide** tab in the **Workflow** screen in Settings and maintenance, you can design project guides that act as guidelines throughout the projects. A project guide consists of statuses containing follow-ups and documents to guide you through the project. Each project guide is linked to a project type, and the project guide is enabled in the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM when the user creates a new project or changes the project type of an existing project, and selects a project type that has a project guide linked to it.

## Example

The "Conference" project type may consist of three statuses: "Planned", "In progress" and "Closing". The "Planned" status may, for example, include the "Planning meeting" follow-up (an appointment) and the "Conference programme" document (a note).
