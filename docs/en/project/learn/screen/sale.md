# Sales tab

**Sales** is one of the section tabs at the bottom of the Project screen. It contains information about any sales linked to the project.

The columns of the **Sales** section tab contain the following information:

* ![icon][img1] : The first column in the **Sales** section tab specifies the **Completed** status of a sale. A tick in the checkbox ![icon][img2] means that the sale is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.
* A [status icon for the sale][1]
  * ![icon][img1] sold
  * ![icon][img3] lost
  * ![icon][img4] stalled
  * if there is no icon, the sale is open
* The date of the sale
* The sale amount
* The current stage of the sale
* The date of the next activity recorded for the sale (the oldest follow-up that has not yet been completed)
* The name of the sale
* The name of the company the sale is linked to
* Any contact the sale is linked to

Double-click a sale in the list to open the Sale screen in SuperOffice CRM which contains information about that [sale][2].
