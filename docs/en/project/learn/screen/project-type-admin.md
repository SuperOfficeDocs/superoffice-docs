# Project - Type, status

The **Project** tab in the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM contains the **Type** field. This field has a predefined list of options which are set up in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

Each project in SuperOffice CRM must have a project type, and each project type can contain several [statuses][1]. You can also specify that specific project types are to have a [project guide][3], to guide you through the different statuses of a project, with associated follow-ups and documents.
