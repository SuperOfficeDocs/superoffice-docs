# Edit project info

You can edit project information directly from the tabs in the Project screen.

## Steps

1. Open the **Project** screen for the project you want to update. See [Use the Find screen][5].

1. Click <i class="ph ph-pencil-simple" aria-label="Edit"></i> in the upper-right corner of the Project card.

1. Make the necessary changes. You can switch between tabs while remaining in edit mode.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Switching project types linked to a [project guide][4] will remove the guide. Activities and documents remain in the **Activities** tab and will relink if you revert to the original type.

1. Click **Save** to save your changes and exit edit mode, or click **Cancel** to discard them. Both actions will exit edit mode.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Save** button appears dimmed, ensure all mandatory fields are filled in. Required fields must be completed before saving.
