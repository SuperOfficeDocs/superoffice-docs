# Delete a project and associated data

1. Open the **Project** screen for the project you want to delete.

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) in the upper-right corner of the Project card.
    Select **Delete** from the menu.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Delete** option appears dimmed, it means that you do not have sufficient user rights to delete this particular item. You cannot delete projects that do not belong to you unless you have the necessary permissions.

1. In the **Delete project** dialog, review the project details to ensure you are deleting the correct project.

1. Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion.
