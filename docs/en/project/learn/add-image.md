# Add a project image

In the **Image** tab, you can add an image for the project. The project image is used primarily when displaying the project in SuperOffice Audience (requires a separate licence), but it can also be used for other types of project displays.

1. Open the **Project** screen. There are several ways to open the **Project** screen:

    * Click the **Project** button in the Navigator.
    * Use the [history list][1] or [FastSearcher][2].
    * Double-click a project in a search result or the **Projects** section tab in the **Company** screen.

2. Select the **Image** tab.

3. Click **Edit**.

4. Click the **Add** button.

5. In the **Select Image** dialog, do one of the following:
    * If the image you want to use is under **Images**, select it to display a preview under **Preview**.
    * To add a new image, click **Add**, select the image you require, and add a description which describes the image better than just its file name. Then click **OK/Save**. Select the image to display a preview under **Preview**.
    * To remove an image from the database, select it and click **Delete**.

6. Click **OK** to add the image. The image is displayed in the **Image** tab and the description in the **Image** field.

7. Click **Save** to save your changes or **Cancel** to close without saving.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To remove an active project image, click **Delete** to the left of the description.
