# Managing project types, statuses, and guides

SuperOffice CRM provides administrators with tools to standardize project workflows through **project types**, **statuses**, and **guides**. These features enable consistent project tracking, task management, and documentation across teams.

Use the **Workflow** and **Lists** screens in **Settings and maintenance** to configure and manage these components.

## Key concepts and locations

| Term | Definition | Location in Settings and maintenance |
|---|---|---|
| Project type | Categorizes projects (for example, "Conference" or "Campaign") and links them to statuses and guides. | **Lists** > **Project - Type, Status** |
| Project status | Tracks the phase of a project (for example, "Planned" or "In Progress"). Defined per project type. | **Lists** > **Project - Status** |
| Project guide | A workflow tool linking statuses to specific follow-ups, documents, and milestones. | **Workflow** > **Project guide** |

## What do you want to do?

* [Add a project status][3]: Define and manage project phases such as "Planned" or "Closing."
* [Add a project type][4]: Create types such as "Campaign" and assign relevant statuses.
* [Create a new project guide][1]: Design workflows with follow-ups, documents, and milestones for project types.
* [Edit or deactivate a project guide][2]: Update workflows or disable guides for specific project types.

These tools empower administrators to tailor project workflows, ensuring efficiency and consistency across teams.
