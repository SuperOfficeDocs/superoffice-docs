# SuperOffice Copilot

The SuperOffice Copilot smoothly integrates a ChatGPT-like user experience with SuperOffice, providing a powerful AI tool within the CRM context. Our aim is to seamlessly embed generative AI within SuperOffice CRM, eliminating the need for external app access while enhancing your workflow directly within the platform.

You can save time and get insights using the different ready-made questions (prompts) in the Company, Contact, Diary, Sale, Project, Request, and Selection screen.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available through our [AI lab program][2]. SuperOffice AI is cloud only.

## Privacy and GDPR

SuperOffice Copilot does not know anything about your customer data and will provide you answers with the help of a large-language-model (LLM) such as Bing from Microsoft or ChatGPT from OpenAI.

## Getting started

The SuperOffice Copilot is available in all screens with the [side panel][1]. By default, the side panel shows a preview of the selected record.

1. Go to a company, contact, diary, sale, project, request, or selection.

1. Click the arrow ![icon][img1] next to the side panel's name and select **SuperOffice Copilot**.

1. After the AI has generated a response, you have the following options:

    * Select the plus or minus icon to get more or less text.
    * Copy the result to the clipboard.
    * Ask another question.
    * Clear the chat.

## Context and language

SuperOffice Copilot uses the language of your SuperOffice application. For example, if you have selected *Deutsch* in **Local settings**, the AI will answer you in German.

The context is always the currently viewed item. For example, when viewing the company "SuperOffice AS", the AI tells you about SuperOffice. If you go to "Visma", AI tells you about that company instead. If you switch to **Project**, the chat is reset and you can select project-related prompts. And so on.
