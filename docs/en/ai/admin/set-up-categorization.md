# Set up AI-based categorization

Categorization uses machine learning to suggest categories for incoming requests based on their content. Before this feature can be used, the AI must be trained using a selection of existing requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Categorization requires the SuperOffice AI Platform and a **Categorization license**. SuperOffice AI is available for CRM Online only.

## 1. Create a selection of requests

You must first create a selection of requests in SuperOffice to train the AI model.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-list-magnifying-glass" aria-label="Find icon"></i> **Find** or go to **New** > **Selection**.

1. Choose **Request** as the selection type. Use **Find Request** or pick from **Typical searches**.

1. Define search criteria:
    1. Add filters to match the requests you want to use for training.
    2. Click **Find**.

    3. Enter a name and click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the first 5000 requests in the selection will be analyzed.

## 2. Choose the selection in Settings and maintenance

1. Open **Settings and maintenance**.
1. Select **AI services** from the Navigator.
1. Under **Categorization**, open the dropdown and search for the selection name.
1. Select the correct request selection.

## 3. Analyze the request selection

Once a valid selection is chosen, the **Analyze requests** button becomes active.

> [!NOTE]
> Large datasets may take hours or even days to analyze.

1. Click **Analyze requests** to start the training process.
1. When training is complete, the **Latest training** status will show *successfully trained model*.
1. If errors occur, review the message and create a new selection if needed.

## 4. Enable suggestions

After successful training:

1. Select the checkbox **Use AI to suggest categories** to activate the feature.

## 5. Result: category suggestions in requests

When enabled, users will see a suggested category in the request footer. Clicking the link applies the category to the request and removes the suggestion.

If there is no match, no suggestion will be shown.

## Re-train or change selection

You can re-analyze a new or updated selection at any time:

1. Go to **Settings and maintenance** > **AI services**.
1. Under **Categorization**, choose a new selection.
1. Click **Analyze requests** to train again.
