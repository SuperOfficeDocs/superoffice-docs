# Categorization

Save time by letting the system categorize requests for you. If this function is active, incoming email requests will be analyzed to determine the best category for each request.

Categorization uses machine learning for learning **which category a request in SuperOffice Service should have**, to automate more of the manual processing our users spend time on today.

For the system to form an opinion on/learn how to automatically categorize between the selected categories the system needs to be trained. This trains the system into understanding how to categorize the selected request.

When the machine has learned how to categorize and the user navigates to a request, there will be a link in the request footer with the text: Suggested category: "category/name". When the user clicks the link, the request will be updated with the suggested category, and the suggestion link disappears.
