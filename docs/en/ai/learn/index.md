# AI services

> [!NOTE]
> SuperOffice AI is available in CRM Online only. It requires the **AI Platform** add-on and specific service licenses. These services are billed monthly per active AI service.

SuperOffice AI helps automate routine tasks and reduce manual work by embedding artificial intelligence directly into the CRM. You can improve response times, reduce errors, and work more efficientlyâ€”without needing technical expertise or coding skills.

These features allow your team to focus on meaningful work, while AI handles repetitive processes in the background.
