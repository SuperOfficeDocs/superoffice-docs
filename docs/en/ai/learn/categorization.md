# Categorization

This feature allows you to train the system to suggest categories for requests, according to the text content related to requests. When a support agent opens a new request, there is a suggested category in the footer of the request. The support agent can then click the category link to update the request with the suggested category. This means time saved, because your support team will not have to read through the request to categorize manually.

To activate this feature, you must first train the AI in how to categorize requests, and then select **Use AI to suggest categories**.

## Training the AI

You train AI by letting the AI analyze a selection of requests.

1. Create a selection of requests in SuperOffice Service.
2. In the list box under **Categorization** in the **AI services** screen, choose the selection you just created.
3. Click **Analyze requests**. The system will give you feedback on how successful the training was. If the selection of requests was insufficient for a successful training, create a bigger selection of requests and try again.

## Include additional sources

At the bottom of this screen, you can include additional sources of text to analyze when categorizing a request.
