# Text analysis

Text analysis uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve customer support by detecting the language and sentiment of incoming requests. It also enables translation of messages in unfamiliar languages, helping support teams respond quickly and effectively.

These tools reduce the need for manual interpretation and allow request handlers to understand the tone, urgency, and content of a message without leaving the **Requests** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> Text analysis requires the SuperOffice AI Platform and a **Text Services license**. SuperOffice AI is available for CRM Online only.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Language detection** | Automatically detects the language of incoming requests. The detected language appears below each message. |
| **Translation** | When language detection is enabled, request handlers can click a link below the message to translate it into their preferred language. The translated subject and body are shown below the original message. |
| **Sentiment analysis** | Automatically analyzes the tone of a message and displays a mood indicator (happy, neutral, or unhappy) below the message. This helps prioritize responses based on emotional tone. |

These features are visible directly in the request view and do not require any configuration by the end user.
