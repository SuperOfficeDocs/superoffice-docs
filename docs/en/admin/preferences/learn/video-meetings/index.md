# Video meetings

In the **Video meetings** tab you can select the video meeting service you want to use in SuperOffice. SuperOffice supports such video meeting services as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex, Zoom and others.

SuperOffice video meetings allow you to create and join video meetings directly from your CRM solution. To set up the video meeting functionality in SuperOffice CRM, you need to connect to one of five video meeting providers (Cisco Webex, Google Meet, Jitsi Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom).

For the users to be able to use video meetings in the Follow-up dialog, there are a few steps involved:

* An administrator needs to connect to one of the chosen video meeting providers available.

* The user needs to use either Mail Link or the SuperOffice Inbox to be able to send video meeting URLs to external users.

* Users have to authenticate (log in) the first time the user clicks on the Video meeting icon in the Follow-up pop-up dialog.

## Pre-requisites for video meetings

* You need a SuperOffice admin account for the setup;
* You need a video provider account, for example, Zoom Pro;
* To be able to send and receive email invitations to video meetings (to/from external users), you must have configured your email setup in SuperOffice CRM (user client) or use SuperOffice Mail Link.

Each video provider has its own requirements to connect their services to SuperOffice CRM. For example, video meetings with Microsoft Teams require a subscription to Microsoft 365 for business, not for home. The latter category includes Personal and Family.
