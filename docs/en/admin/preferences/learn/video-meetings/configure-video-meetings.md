# Configure video meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To send and receive email invitations to video meetings (to/from external users), you must have configured your email setup in SuperOffice CRM (user client) or use SuperOffice Mail Link. See [Email setup for video meetings][2].

## Select and configure outgoing video meetings

1. [!include[Open preferences](../includes/open-preferences.md)]

2. Select the **Video meetings** tab.

3. Click the **Configure** button.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a service provider has already been selected, click **Disconnect** before selecting a new one.

4. In the new browser tab, select the service provider your company uses for video meetings.

5. You are forwarded to the service provider's authentication portal. Do the following:

    * [Authenticate and validate your user][1].
    * Confirm that the service provider is allowed to connect to SuperOffice.

6. When you have completed the step above, you are redirected back to the **Video meetings** screen.

7. Verify that the configuration is set up correctly. Under **Set configurations** you should now see the name of the selected service provider and your user name.

8. Depending on the service provider you selected, there may be additional settings to configure here. Edit the settings as necessary and click **Save**.

9. You can now close the browser tab and return to SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

To select another provider or change the configuration, click **Configure**.
