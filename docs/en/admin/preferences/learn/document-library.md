# Document library

By default, your SuperOffice site is connected to the SuperOffice document library. All documents, templates and emails are stored in this library.

If your organization is using SharePoint, you can configure SuperOffice to use SharePoint as the default document library.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can start this configuration, you must set up site permissions and library permissions in SharePoint.
