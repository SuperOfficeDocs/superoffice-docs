# Document library

By default, your SuperOffice site is connected to the SuperOffice document library. All documents, templates and emails are stored in this library.

If your organization is using SharePoint, you can configure SuperOffice to use SharePoint as the default document library.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can start this configuration, you must set up site permissions and library permissions in SharePoint.

## SharePoint document library integration

SuperOffice's SharePoint document library integration lets you create, archive and share documents and emails effortlessly and securely.

This integration allows you to store all documents and emails in SharePoint Online, where they can be accessed by everyone in the company, including even those who do not use SuperOffice CRM. The access to your SuperOffice document site in SharePoint can be controlled through domain groups (AAD = Azure active directory authentication).
