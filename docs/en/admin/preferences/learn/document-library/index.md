# Document library

By default, your SuperOffice site is connected to the SuperOffice document library. All files, templates and emails are stored in this library.

If your organization is using SharePoint, you can configure SuperOffice to use SharePoint as the default document library.

## SuperOffice document library

The standard setup for SuperOffice is the SO_Arc document library. All files, templates and emails are stored in this library.

## SharePoint document library integration

SuperOffice's SharePoint document library integration lets you create, archive and share documents and emails effortlessly and securely.

This integration allows you to store all documents and emails in SharePoint Online, where they can be accessed by everyone in the company, including even those who do not use SuperOffice CRM. The access to your SuperOffice document site in SharePoint can be controlled through Microsoft Entra domain groups (formerly Azure Active Directory).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you can start this configuration, you must set up site permissions and library permissions in SharePoint.
