# Displaying different levels

You can choose which settings to display in the list based on the [level][1] they are specified for, in the **Active settings** field. The levels displayed depend on which of the following checkboxes you check at the bottom of the field:

* User
* Group
* Database

> [!NOTE]
> Settings for the system level are always displayed.

You can use these checkboxes to show one, two or all levels.
