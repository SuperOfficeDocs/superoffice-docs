# Active settings

The **Active settings** field contains a list of the settings for the preference currently selected in the **Preferences** list, and the levels and the values for each. You can edit and delete existing settings and add new ones in this field.

The field consists of three columns:

* **Who**: Shows who the setting applies to (the name of the system, database, group or user).

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this is an individual user, a tooltip about this user will pop up when you hold the mouse pointer over the user's initials in this column.

* **Level**: shows which [level the setting applies to][1] (system, database, group or user).

* **Value**: shows the value specified for the setting.

The contents of these columns are defined in the **Setting** dialog. [How to add preference settings][2].

You can sort the rows in the columns by clicking on the required column heading. Click the column heading onc to sort in reverse order.
