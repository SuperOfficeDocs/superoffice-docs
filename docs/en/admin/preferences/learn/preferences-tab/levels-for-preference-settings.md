# Levels for preference settings

You can specify preference settings for four different levels:

| Level | Description |
|---|---|
| System | Global preferences that apply to all users in the system, including all satellites, groups and individual users. |
| Database | Preferences that apply to one specific database and all groups and users connected to this database. |
| Group | Preferences that apply to all users in a specific group. |
| User | Preferences that are linked to each individual user. |

> [!NOTE]
> Preferences that can be set only on a global (system) level, are located in the [Global preferences][1] tab.

You can specify different values for different levels so that, for example, you can have one setting for a user and a different setting for the user group that the contact belongs to. The lowest level always applies.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all levels are available for all preferences. If any of the options are disabled, you cannot choose them for the selected preference.
