# Preference section FieldReplication

[!include[SQL](./includes/to-view-pref.md)]

```SQL
SELECT * FROM UserPreference WHERE prefsection='FieldReplication'
```

Enables replication of user-defined fields at field level instead of at record level. This ensures that field changes for the customer are retained, but may affect the performance of the replication process. This will affect the size of UP/DWN files and how conflicts are handled by the travel system.
