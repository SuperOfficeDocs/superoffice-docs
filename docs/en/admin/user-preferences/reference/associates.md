# Preference section Associates

[!include[SQL](./includes/to-view-pref.md)]

```SQL
SELECT * FROM UserPreference WHERE prefsection='Associates'
```

Associate preferences like which radio-button did I select the last time I used this dialog/control
or which item did I select last time I used this drop-down list.

| Preference | Description | Default | Control type | Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| ResourceSubListWeb | Preference used to remember the setup/state of the Filter dialog<br>-2 = All resources<br>-1 = History<br>>0 = ID of resource heading | | Number | crm |
| AssocHomeCountry | Home country of associate if it differs from company | | | |
