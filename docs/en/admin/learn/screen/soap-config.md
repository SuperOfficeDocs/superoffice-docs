# SOAP (ONSITE only)

In the SOAP screen, you can configure the SOAP interface. You can set up 3 types of port access:

* **Port: Customer**: This tab specifies which IP addresses should have access to the port which offers customer-portal-related functionality. This includes the customer's requests and external messages and the knowledge base.
* **Port: Request**: This tab relates to request handling functionality in SuperOffice Service. Computers with IP addresses within one of the ranges specified here will have access to running SOAP functions that provide this functionality.
* **Port: Admin**: This tab deals with functionality relating to the setup and configuration of SuperOffice Service. Computers with IP addresses within one of the ranges specified here will have access to running SOAP functions that provide this functionality.

## What do you want to do?

* [Add an IP address range][1]
