# Get your users on board

A CRM system is only successful if it is used by the people it was intended for. To help you manage the changes within your organization that an introduction of a CRM system entails, and maximize the CRM user adoption rate, we have gathered a few tips that'll help you get users on board.

## Tips and best practices

### Appoint a CRM ambassador

Start by appointing a person in your organization who would act an ambassador for CRM. This person, also known as an administrator (super-user), can be responsible for creating routines and guidelines, ensure data quality, and follow up on users if they have questions or are doing something wrong.

When needed, this person can, for example, organize workshops that introduce best practices and document the results. This person needs to be an expert in the system and have a certain authority in the company to be able to carry out the CRM initiative.

### Involve users from the start

It is in human nature to resist change. The reasons for resistance to change can be fear of the unknown, of having to do more work, and unwanted changes in daily tasks and routines.

You can remove all this uncertainty by involving the end-users from the start, by clearly demonstrating how the new system will benefit them, by asking for user feedback. Be sure to listen to the feedback and incorporate suggestions when appropriate.

### Make sure the system is easy to use

SuperOffice CRM is supposed to make life easier for your users, not harder. Therefore, tailor the solution to reflect the way your users work and not the other way around. When you implement the workflows that bring results, your CRM solution will be easier to adopt.

Users hate interfaces cluttered with irrelevant information, so leave only the information your team will need today. You can add more later, if needed. In addition, make sure all the users have installed WebTools.

### Create a routine guide

A CRM routine guide outlines what kind of information and how the users should capture in the CRM system, as well as who is responsible for what. It also reinforces the actions and behaviors you want your end-users to adopt in order to achieve business goals.

Be sure to update this routine guide continuously to reflect changes, either in the CRM (possibly due to upgrades) or the new routines you have decided on. Learn more about creating a CRM routine guide.

### Train your employees

Set aside enough time for training your employees. You will find a free gamified eLearning tool available in SuperOffice CRM. Just go to the Help menu, click What's new, then go to the second page and click Start playing now.

### Reward users

Review how your employees have used the CRM system and think about rewarding those who use it well and often. The reward system is a great way to get all users moving in the same direction.

For example, you could look at how many outbound calls a user has registered in the system, how many leads they have converted into a sale, and how accurate their data entry is. Then you could reward the best user and make others know what they did to achieve this reward.

### Summary

It is great that you have purchased and implemented a CRM system. You will get many benefits from the solution. The only thing you need to do now is to get your users to use it in the way that it was meant to be used, and in a way that supports your business processes.

Start with being a good example yourself, use SuperOffice CRM every day and adopt it to your daily routine. By following the six best practices above, we are sure that you will come far. Good luck!

## Install WebTools for your users

WebTools must be installed for all users to ensure the integration between SuperOffice and MS Office Outlook and documents. Every user will receive an email with instructions when they start with SuperOffice, but as an administrator, it is important to make sure it is done.

A great way to keep track of relevant email communication with customers is to store it in SuperOffice. That way everyone can see if someone has been in touch with a particular customer lately, and what this communication was about.

By installing WebTools you will get your email and documents integrated with SuperOffice. You can save any incoming or outgoing email with one click. The users need administrator rights to install WebTools, so help them install it correctly.
