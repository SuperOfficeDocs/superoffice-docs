# Options

In the **Options** screen, you define settings that are valid for the whole system, specifically for free-text searches, time zones, number allocation, and labels. Most companies do not need to alter the default settings supplied with SuperOffice CRM. However, if you do need to change them, use the **Options** screen.

## Tabs in the Options screen

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| [Free-text search][3] | Here you can manage how the free-text search function works in SuperOffice CRM. |
| [Time zones][4] | Here you can manage time zone functionality. |
| [Number allocation][1] | Specify here a start number for the **Number** fields in the Company screen, Project screen, Sale screen and the contact card, and for document templates. |
| [Labels][2] | Here you can change the name of specific fields in SuperOffice CRM. |
| [Customer languages][6] | Here you can configure the customer languages, making it easy to communicate with customers in different languages. You can also set up category names in SuperOffice Customer Centre. |

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has a licence for [SAINT][7], the **Options** screen also contains the **Status monitors** tab.
