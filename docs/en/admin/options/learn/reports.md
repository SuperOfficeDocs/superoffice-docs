# Reports

From the **Reports** tab in the **Options** screen, you can edit the names and descriptions of standard reports in SuperOffice CRM. In addition, you can choose which reports are published (meaning made available to users). You also have the option of importing new reports.

The report list shows the format of the reports (appearance), whether a report is a standard report, the report type (content), and if it is published. Click a report to display the report description at the bottom of the tab.

## Open and edit a standard report

1. Go to the **Reports** tab in the **Options** screen.
2. Double-click the standard report you want to edit.
3. In the **Edit report** dialog, edit the name and description. You cannot edit the report type.
4. Check the **Published** checkbox to make the report available to users.
5. Click **Save**.

You cannot delete standard reports, but you can specify them as not published.

## Import reports

You can import reports that have been exported from SuperOffice Reporter Studio, or created by a consultant or by SuperOffice Support.

1. Go to the **Reports** tab in the **Options** screen.
2. Click **Import** at the bottom of the tab.
3. Click **Browse** in the dialog that appears.
4. Select the report you want to import, and click **Open** and **Save**.

If the import is successful, the report is shown in the **Reports** tab with your user name as the owner.
