# View number allocation

In the top part of the **Number allocation** tab is a table showing the counters defined for SuperOffice CRM (see also [Number allocation][1]).

The table consists of the following columns:

* **\[Icon\]**: Shows where in SuperOffice CRM the counter is used, for example, ![icon][img1] for the **Company** screen.
* **Counter**: shows the name of the counter, for example, **Company number**, which applies to the **Number** field in the **Company** screen.
* **Next**: shows the next value for the counter.
* **Allocate**: specifies if the automatic counter function is used, so that the system enters values for you.
* **Unique**: specifies if the counter values must be unique. Useful when SuperOffice CRM users allocate values themselves.
* **Read only**: Specifies whether SuperOffice CRM users can type values into the counter fields themselves.
* **Allow blank**: specifies if an empty counter field is a permitted value. Useful when the counter values must be unique. If **Allow blank** is checked, this means that the requirement for unique values does not apply to empty fields.
* **Last used**: shows when the counter field was last used.
* **By - User ID**: shows who last used the counter field.
* **By - Portrait**: shows a thumbnail image of the user who last used the counter field.
