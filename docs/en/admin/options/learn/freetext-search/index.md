# Freetext search

Using the freetext search function in SuperOffice CRM, users can search for text throughout the application. This applies to text which they themselves have added to the database, for example, company names, departments, and text from the Contact and Document screens. You can define exactly how this will work in SuperOffice CRM using this tab in Settings and maintenance.
