# Delete stopwords

The object of deleting stopwords is to include them in freetext searches after having excluded them. To delete a stopword from the list:

[!include[Go to freetext search tab](../includes/goto-freetext.md)]

1. Check that freetext search is enabled for SuperOffice CRM (see [Enable freetext search][1]).

1. Select the required stopword.

1. Click the **Delete** button below the stopword list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Changes to the stopword list do not have a retroactive effect. That is, deleted stopwords will still function as stopwords for fields that were created before you deleted them. If you want your changes to apply retroactively, you can generate a new freetext index.
