# Suggest stopwords

> [!NOTE]
> You can also choose the stopwords manually. See [Add stopwords][1].

[!include[Go to freetext search tab](../includes/goto-freetext.md)]

1. Check that freetext search is enabled for SuperOffice CRM (see [Enable freetext search][2]).

1. Click the **Suggest** button below the stopword list.

1. A message is displayed to the effect that it can take a long time for the system to traverse the glossary and the index to find possible stopwords. Click **OK**.

1. When the system has found possible stopwords, these are displayed in the **New Stopwords** dialog. The most frequently used words in the database are displayed at the top. Check the ones you want to include as stopwords. Hold down the **CTRL** key and click the relevant stopwords.

1. Click **Save**.

1. A message is displayed to remind you that changes in the stopword list do not have a retroactive effect, which means that new stopwords will not apply to fields that were created before the stopwords were defined. Click **OK**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want your changes to apply retroactively, you can generate a new freetext index. See [Regenerate a freetext index][3].
