# Customer languages

[!include[Requirement](../../../../learn/includes/req-cep.md)]

To offer great customer experience you need to support your customers in their local language when they visit your Customer centre and in the communication with the customer.

By [setting up extra languages][1] you make it easy for your customers to register, comment on and check the status of their requests in their preferred language. In addition, they will have access to all the FAQs in their chosen language.

Out of the box you can add 6 different languages. If the language you wish to use isn't available, please contact us and our consultants will be able to help you add the additional languages you need.

## The Customer languages screen

In the **Customer languages** screen is a list of the installed customer languages. From this screen you can configure the customer languages, making it easy to communicate with customers in different languages.

For example:

* You can have [multiple language versions][2] of SuperOffice Customer Centre, FAQs, and reply templates.
* You can specify a language for a contact, so that person will automatically receive reply templates in that language.
* [Requests to user support can be categorized][3] in several groups that can refer to defined departments and languages.

On installation, 6 customer language folders (DE, DK, EN, NL, NO and SE) were placed in the folder **\\templates** on the server. You must set up these customer languages yourself.
