# Options

In the **Options** screen, you define settings that are valid for the whole system, specifically for freetext searches, time zones, number allocation, labels and reports. Most companies do not need to alter the default settings supplied with SuperOffice CRM. However, if you do need to change them, use the **Options** screen.

## Tabs in the Options screen

| Tab | Description | Read more |
|---|---|---|
| Freetext search | Here you can manage how the freetext search function works in SuperOffice CRM. | [Freetext search][1] |
| Time zones | Here you can manage time zone functionality. | [Time zones][2] |
| Number allocation | Specify here a start number for the **Number** fields in the **Company** screen, **Project** screen, **Sale** screen and the contact card, and for document templates. | [Number allocation][3] |
| Labels | Here you can change the name of specific fields in SuperOffice CRM. | [Labels][4] |
| Reports | Here you can edit information about standard reports and import new report templates. | [Reports][5] |
| Customer languages | Here you can configure the customer languages, making it easy to communicate with customers in different languages. You can also set up category names in SuperOffice Customer Centre. | [Customer languages][6] |

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has a licence for [SAINT][7], the **Options** screen also contains the **Status monitors** tab.
