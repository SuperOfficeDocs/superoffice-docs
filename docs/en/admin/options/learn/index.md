# Options

In the **Options** screen, you define settings that are valid for the whole system, specifically for freetext searches, time zones, number allocation, labels and reports. Most companies do not need to alter the default settings supplied with SuperOffice CRM. However, if you do need to change them, use the **Options** screen.

## Tabs in the Options screen

| Tab | Description | Read more |
|---|---|---|
| Free-text search | Here you can manage how the free-text search function works in SuperOffice CRM. | [Free-text search][1] |
| Time zones | Here you can manage time zone functionality. | [Time zones][2] |
