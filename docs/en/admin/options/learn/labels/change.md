# Change UI labels

SuperOffice contains several fields whose names can be changed to customize the program to your organization's own requirements.

You can change labels in all available languages in SuperOffice. For example, you may decide that all *Company* fields should be called *Organization* instead.

[!include[Go to Options](../includes/open-options.md)]

1. Select the **Labels** tab.

1. Check **Enable label substitution**.

1. Type in all or part of the label you want to change in the field below the language field on the left. This is the language selected for your user.

    > [!TIP]
    > To search for labels in another language, select the language in the list on the right and enter the search word in the field below.

1. Press **ENTER**. The list is updated with labels containing the search text.

    > [!TIP]
    > Hold the mouse pointer over a row to display the resource ID for the label.

1. Double-click the label you want to change.

1. Edit the text for the language in question in the dialog.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is possible to edit the label for all available languages in this dialog. Not limited to the selected target language.

1. Click **Save**.
