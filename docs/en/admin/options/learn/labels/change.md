# Change labels

SuperOffice contains several fields whose names can be changed to customize the program to your organization's own requirements.

You can change labels in all available languages in SuperOffice. For example, you may decide that all *Company* fields should be called *Organization* instead.

> [!NOTE]
> These changes apply only to SuperOffice CRM and not, for example, to reports or labels in Reporter Studio.
