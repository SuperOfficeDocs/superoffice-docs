# ERP

[!include[Requirement](../../includes/req-integration-server.md)]

If your organization uses an ERP system and has connected it to SuperOffice CRM, you have the option of synchronizing companies (customers and suppliers) and projects between the ERP system and SuperOffice CRM.

On the main **Company**, **Contact** and **Project** cards, the **ERP** tab is displayed. Here you can link a SuperOffice company to a customer/supplier in the ERP system. Contacts who are registered on the SuperOffice company can then be linked to individuals in the ERP system. Similarly, SuperOffice projects can be linked to projects in the ERP system. After you have set up the link, data is synchronized between the ERP system and SuperOffice CRM.
