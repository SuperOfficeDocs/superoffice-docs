# The ERP tab

The **ERP** tab is displayed if your organization has a license for [Development Tools][1]. It allows integration between SuperOffice CRM and your ERP system, facilitating data sharing between the two.

* **Company** and **Contact** screens: Link a company and its associated contacts to matching records in the ERP system.

* **Project** screen: Establish connections between SuperOffice projects and ERP projects. If a connection exists, click **Sync Now** to synchronize the data.

This integration ensures data consistency across systems, reducing manual updates and errors.

[!NOTE]
The ERP tab will only appear for users with the appropriate license and settings enabled in Settings and maintenance.
