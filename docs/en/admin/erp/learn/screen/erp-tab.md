# The ERP tab

If your organization has a license for SuperOffice Integration Server, the **ERP** tab is displayed in the **Contact** and **Project** screens.

## Contact screen

If a company is connected to the ERP system, any contacts associated with this company can also be connected to a matching individual in the ERP system.

## Project screen

Here you can create a connection between SuperOffice projects and projects in the ERP system.

If a connection has already been created, you can click **Sync Now** to synchronize the data between SuperOffice CRM and the ERP system.
