# Create an import file

To make it easier for you to import contacts, we have created an import template you can download and use to import. In this Excel spreadsheet, we have set up the basic data fields in columns, and all you have to do is copy your contact details into the right cells.

## Companies and contacts

The Excel spreadsheet should as a minimum contain columns with:

* Company names
* Contact names (first name and last name)

> [!TIP]
> Check that the data is up-to-date. For example, are postal addresses and telephone numbers correct?

## Tips

* Some of the fields in SuperOffice CRM are **mandatory**. When you import companies and contacts, make sure to include the columns Category, Business, and Contact/company number in your import file. When you import product information, add Product Code, List price and Name.

* If you want to import several contacts from a company, you need to add one row for each contact person and add the same company name to all the rows.

* Keep in mind that the quality of the data you import determines the quality of your CRM data. We recommend that you go through your data and clean the import file before you start. Imports with huge amounts of data can be quite an exercise to clean up if things go wrong.
