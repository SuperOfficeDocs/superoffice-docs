# Import from Gmail

## Import companies/contacts from Gmail

1. [!include[Open Import](includes/open-import.md)]

2. Click the ![icon][img2] Gmail icon under **Select an import source**.

3. Give access. The dialog shown depends on if you are already logged in to Gmail

    * If the **Request for permission** dialog appears, you are already logged in to Gmail. Click **Give access**.

    * If the **Google accounts** dialog appears, you are not logged in to Gmail. Type in the user name and password, and log in to Gmail. Click **Give access**.
        Your Gmail companies will be displayed in Settings and maintenance.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The companies from Gmail will not be imported into the SuperOffice database yet. SuperOffice will only upload the company list from Gmail, so that you can specify the import settings.
