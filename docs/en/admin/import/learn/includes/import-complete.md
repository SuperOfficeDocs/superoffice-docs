When the import finishes, two lists are displayed:

* New companies and contacts that were imported.
* Existing companies and contacts that were changed as a result of the import.

Above each list is a link to the selection with the new/changed companies/contacts.

> [!TIP]
> If you have imported new companies/contacts and there are problems with the imported data, you can open this selection in SuperOffice CRM and delete the new companies/contacts.
