**Many contacts are shown without an icon. Does this mean they will not be imported?**

Rows without icons are not imported. If you see that many contacts are not being imported, this may be because they are not linked to a company. In that case, you can do one of the following:

* If the contact is actually linked to a company, you return to the import source (Gmail, Outlook or Excel) and specify a company for the contact. Then start the import afresh.

* If the contact is not linked to a company, but should be registered under their own name in SuperOffice, set up the person as a company:

    1. Click **Previous** and **Configure import settings**.
    2. Click the **If no company name** list under **Contact**.
    3. Select **Create company using contact name**.
    4. Click **Save**.
    5. Click **Next**, and check that the [New company icon][img1] icon is displayed next to the contact. The person is registered as a company in SuperOffice CRM with themselves as the only contact.
