# Import from Outlook

[!include[Back up database before import](includes/caution-backup-before-import.md)]

## A. Import companies/contacts from Outlook

1. [!include[Open Import](includes/open-import.md)]

2. Click the ![icon][img2] Outlook icon under **Select an import source**. Outlook will open and a dialog is displayed while the export from Outlook is in progress.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The companies/contacts from Outlook will not be imported into the SuperOffice database yet. SuperOffice will only upload the company/contact list from Outlook, so that you can specify the import settings.

    When the import from Outlook is finished, the companies/contacts are displayed in the **Import** screen.

### Is an error message displayed?

[!include[WebTools](includes/missing-webtools.md)]
