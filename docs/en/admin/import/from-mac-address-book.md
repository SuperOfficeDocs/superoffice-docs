# Import from Mac Address book

[!include[Back up database before import](includes/caution-backup-before-import.md)]

## Import companies/contacts from Mac Address book

<!-- NEED complete rewrite to get correct behavior, need more info from Max/Office integration team.  -->
The icon in Import appears if user have WebTools for Mac installed and opening Settings and maintenance.

1. [!include[Open Import](includes/open-import.md)]

2. Click the ![icon][img2] Mac icon under **Select an import source**. Mac Address book will open and a dialog is displayed while the export from Address book is in progress.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The companies/contacts from Outlook will not be imported into the SuperOffice database yet. SuperOffice will only upload the company/contact list from Outlook, so that you can specify the import settings.

    When the import from Outlook is finished, the companies/contacts are displayed in the **Import** screen.
