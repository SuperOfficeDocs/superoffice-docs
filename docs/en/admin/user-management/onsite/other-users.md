# Manage anonymous users and system users (Onsite)

* **System user**: System users can log in to the system via third-party applications and have all rights.
* **Anonymous**: Anonymous users have rights based on the [role for anonymous users](#rights). It is not usually necessary to have more than one anonymous user set up.

> [!NOTE]
> Anonymous users and system users require the [SuperOffice Expander Services][1] system license and can be managed in the **Other users** tab:
>
> 1. Select <i class="ph ph-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Users** in the Navigator.
> 1. Select the **Other users** tab. The list displays existing anonymous users and system users.

## Add anonymous user or system user

1. Click **Add** below the list.

1. Enter an ID in the **User ID** field.

1. Enter, if required, a password for the user in the **Password** field.

1. Enter a description of the user, as appropriate, in the **Description** box.

1. Select **Type**: **System user** or **Anonymous**.

1. Select **Active** to the right of **Login** to activate the user.

1. Click **Save**. The user is added to the list.

## <a id="rights"></a>Edit rights for anonymous users

1. [Enter the data rights in the **Data rights** tab][2].

The changes are saved automatically.

## Change login rights for other users

If an anonymous user or a system user is no longer to have the option of logging in to the system, you can remove their login rights. The external user will not be removed, but defined as inactive and can always be reactivated if required.

    This user can then no longer log in to the system.
