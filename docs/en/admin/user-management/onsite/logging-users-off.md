# Log users off (Onsite)

If a user is denied access to SuperOffice CRM, for example, after a program crash, the administrator can log off the user in Settings and maintenance, so that the user can log in again as normal.

1. [!include[Click Users](../includes/goto-users.md)]

2. Select the **Associates** tab.

3. Select the required company in the **Company** list box.

4. Select **Logged-on to Windows client** in the list box below the list of users.

5. Select the required user in the list.

6. Click the **Task** button and select **Log user off**. The user is logged off.

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is not logged in or something other than **Logged-on to Windows client** is selected in the **View** list box, this button is disabled.
