# Manage anonymous users and system users (Onsite)

## Change login rights for other users

2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]

    This user can then no longer log in to the system.

### Activate a user

1. [!include[Click Users](includes/goto-users.md)]
2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]
3. In the list, double-click the user you want to activate.
4. Select **Active** to the right of **Login** to activate the user.
5. Click **Save**. This user can then log in to the system.

## Delete anonymous or system user

1. [!include[Click Users](includes/goto-users.md)]
2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]
3. Select the user you want to delete.
4. Click the **Delete** button. The user is removed from the list.
