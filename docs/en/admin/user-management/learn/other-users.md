# Manage anonymous users and system users (Onsite)

* **Anonymous**: [!include[Access rights](includes/def-anon-user.md)]

## Change login rights for other users

If an anonymous user or a system user is no longer to have the option of logging in to the system, you can remove their login rights. The external user will not be removed, but defined as inactive and can always be reactivated if required.

2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]

    This user can then no longer log in to the system.

### Activate a user

1. [!include[Click Users](includes/goto-users.md)]
2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]
3. In the list, double-click the user you want to activate.
4. Select **Active** to the right of **Login** to activate the user.
5. Click **Save**. This user can then log in to the system.

## Delete anonymous or system user

1. [!include[Click Users](includes/goto-users.md)]
2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]
3. Select the user you want to delete.
4. Click the **Delete** button. The user is removed from the list.
