# Manage "Our companies"

## Pre-requisites

To add a company in the **Our companies** tab, it must first be registered as a company in SuperOffice.

To delete companies in the **Our companies** tab, the following two criteria must be satisfied:

* The company must not have any associates registered. The number of associates is displayed in the **Associates** column in the company list. To delete a company, you must first [delete the registered associates][2].

* The company cannot be an active satellite. Check if the company is listed in the **Active satellite** column in the company list.

## Add company in the Our companies tab

1. Open the Users screen.

2. Select the **Our companies** tab.

3. Click the **Add** button below the company list.

4. The Find screen opens. If there are already search criteria entered, but they are not ones you want to use, click the **Deactivate all** button to remove them or remove the checks from the checkboxes for the relevant criteria.

5. Search for a company. See details below.

6. When you have selected the company you require and clicked **OK**, it is displayed in the list.

## How do I search for a company?

1. In the list box to the right of the field you want to search on, choose if you want to search for a company that **Starts with**, **Contains**, or **Equals** the search criteria you enter.

3. When you have specified the required criteria, click the **Find** button.

4. When the search is finished, these are the possible outcomes:
