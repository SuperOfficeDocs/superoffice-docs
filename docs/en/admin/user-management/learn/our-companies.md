# Manage "Our companies"

## Pre-requisites

To add a company in the **Our companies** tab, it must first be registered as a company in SuperOffice.

To delete companies in the **Our companies** tab, the following two criteria must be satisfied:

* The company must not have any associates registered. The number of associates is displayed in the **Associates** column in the company list. To delete a company, you must first [delete the registered associates][2].

* The company cannot be an active satellite. Check if the company is listed in the **Active satellite** column in the company list.

1. Open the Users screen.

2. Select the **Our companies** tab.

3. Click the **Add** button below the company list.
