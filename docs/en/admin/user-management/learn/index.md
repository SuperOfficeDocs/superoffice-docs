# Users

As an administrator you're in charge of adding and managing your users. In this section you will learn how to add new users, how to assign the right user roles and groups, and help the users with setup and WebTools.

## User types

* **Associates**: SuperOffice CRM users (in your company)

* **Other users**: Anonymous users and system users (onsite only)

* **Anonymous users**: Users with limited rights defined by the [role for anonymous users][4]. Anonymous users can be used, for instance, to provide access to web pages. In this way, salespersons can make relevant information from SuperOffice CRM available on a website that does not require a login, to give customers easy access to it.

* **System users**: [!include[Access rights](includes/def-system-user.md)]

    The system user is intended for integration and can be used to allow processes full access to the SuperOffice database for replicating diaries, for example.

## Associates

**Associates** are SuperOffice users in your company (or a related company such as a subsidiary).

In the **Associates** tab in the Users screen, you can add users of the type **Associate**, and assign them roles, groups and licenses, edit existing users and delete users.

For a person to be registered as a SuperOffice CRM user, this person must be registered with a company displayed in the **Company** list box in the Users screen. And for a company to be displayed in the **Company** list box in the Users screen, the company must appear on the company list in the **Our companies** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> In the Users screen you specify which licenses you want different users to have. To add new system licenses or increase/reduce the number of licenses for one or more modules, contact SuperOffice to [update the license information][6].
