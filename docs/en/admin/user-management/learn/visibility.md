# Visibility

If you can view specific documents, sales, follow-ups and selections does not depend solely on the [role][1] you are assigned. Certain individual items of information may not be available to you. In the documents and follow-ups dialogs and in the Sale and Selection screens, there is a list box called **Visible for**. In the Sale screen, you can, for example, choose to make the sale visible to everyone, visible only to the primary group that the owner belongs to, or visible only to the owner.

This requires the license **Confidential activities**.

To set this license, find the wanted user, click the **Licences** tab and then mark the **Confidential activities** checkbox.
