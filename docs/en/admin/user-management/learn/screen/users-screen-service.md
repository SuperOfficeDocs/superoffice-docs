# Users (Service)

Selecting ![icon][img1] **System settings > Users** takes you the **Users** screen, where you have the following options:

* In the **Users** tab, you can see all the individual users.
* In the **User groups** tab, you can see the existing user groups.

To create, delete or restore users, go to SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

## Users tab

In the **Users** tab, you can display all the users registered in the system. Using the **Filter** field at the top of the tab, you can apply the following filters to the list:

* **All**: Shows all the users registered in the system.
* **Service users**: Shows all users with an active user license. In practice, this means all active users.
* **Deleted**: Shows all deleted users. When you delete a user in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, this person remains in the system, but is marked as deleted. Their history is retained, but by deleting them, you free up a user license. You can restore a deleted user, by reactivate the user license in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.
* **User groups**: If you select a user group, all members of that group are displayed.

Clicking a user takes you to the **Edit users** screen, which contains all the information recorded about this user.

## User groups tab

Using the **User groups** tab in the **Users** screen, you can collect the users into groups. Users groups can be linked to categories, so that category membership for users is easier to administer.
