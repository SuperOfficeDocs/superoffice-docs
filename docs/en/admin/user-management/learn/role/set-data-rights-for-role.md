# Set data rights for a role

[!include[Requirement](../includes/note-anon-req.md)]

You can set rights for data objects based on who owns the object. All users who belong to this role will be assigned rights based on the settings you make here.

<details><summary>What are data objects?</summary>

[!include[List of data objects](includes/list-of-data-objects.md)]
</details>

**Steps:**

1. [!include[Open Roles](includes/open-roles.md)]

2. Choose the **Associates** tab or the **External** tab (<!-- onsite-->).

    <details><summary>Do you want to edit the role for anonymous users?</details>
    See [Edit rights for anonymous users][1].
    </details>

3. Select the required role in the **Roles** list. The rights for the selected role are displayed in the **Data rights** tab.

4. Click the arrow (![icon][img3] ) next to the right you want to change, and select the required right.

    <details><summary>What do the different rights mean?</summary>
    [!include[Table showing rights per role](includes/table-role-rights.md)]
    </details>

    The changes are saved automatically.

## What do the different columns under Data owned by mean?

| Data owned by | Explanation|
|---|---|
| My own | Created by you |
| Primary group (A) | Created by your primary group (department) |
| My Company (E) | Created by an external user's company |
| Other groups (A) | Created by a user group you belong to |
| Same project (E) | Created in a project an external user belongs to |
| Other associates | Created by other associates in the company |
| External user | Created by external users (Audience users) |
| Anonymous | Created by anonymous users |

* A = Associates
* E = External

## How do I display data objects for external users?

If the data objects (companies, projects, documents and so on) are to be made accessible to external users (Audience users), it is not enough just to assign the external users read (or higher) access. The data objects must also be published in SuperOffice CRM.

## Access rights to reports

All SuperOffice CRM users have access to the **Reports** screen in SuperOffice CRM, but the individual reports you can access depend on the rights you have in respect of follow-ups, documents, sales and the activities list (see [Role][2]). In practice, this means that you cannot generate reports for content you do not have permission to view in SuperOffice CRM.
