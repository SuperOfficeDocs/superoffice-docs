# The Licences screen

## The SuperOffice tab

In the **SuperOffice** tab in the **Licences** screen, you can view and update the license information for your version of SuperOffice CRM and associated modules.

> [!NOTE]
> If a third-party module or similar is installed, several tabs are displayed here.

### Owner information

At the top is the company name (your company/organization) and serial number. If the license is time-limited, the expiry date is displayed below the serial number.

The list at the bottom shows which licenses are in use and how many are available. Click a license name to view information about a license.

### License list

## The Status tab

Updated information about the system is displayed in the **Status** tab in the **Licences** screen. The **Status** screen is divided into the following main sections:

### Database

Shows the database owner, serial number, and type, which are specified on installation. It also shows if it is a central database or a satellite database. You can see the next expiry date and the name of the user currently logged in.

### Metered services

Click this button to open the dashboard for your metered services.

Metered services are services that are invoiced once you exceed a certain level/number of

* Storage space used
* Emails sent via Mailings
* Customer center logins
* Chat sessions started
* Form submissions

Administrators can keep track of exactly how much each service is used per month. Whenever your company exceeds the threshold, youâ€™ll automatically be invoiced for these services on your next monthly invoice. The threshold depends on the number of users. The more users you have, the higher the threshold will be.

### System notifications

This list shows status messages from the system and added [events][1]. Notifications of active imports, SAINT or freetext indexing, and so on. Select a notification in the list to display a description. You can keep track of events that are active in the system.

The **System events** tab consists of two parts:

* **Events**.
* **Description**, shows detailed information about the event currently selected under **Events**.

Under **System notifications** you will find the following columns:

| Column | Description |

| Status | Shows the status of the event. |
| Message | Shows the description of the event. |
