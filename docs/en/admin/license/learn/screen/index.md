# The Licences screen

## The SuperOffice tab

In the **SuperOffice** tab in the Licences screen, you can view and update the license information for your version of SuperOffice CRM and associated modules.

> [!NOTE]
> If a third-party add-on is installed, several tabs are displayed here.

### Owner information

At the top is the company name (your company/organization) and serial number. If the license is time-limited, the expiry date is displayed below the serial number.

The list at the bottom shows which licenses are in use and how many are available. Click a license name to view information about a license.

## The Status tab

Updated information about the system is displayed in the **Status** tab in the Licences screen. The **Status** screen is divided into the following main sections:

### Database

Shows the database owner, serial number, and type, which are specified on installation. It also shows if it is a central database or a satellite database. You can see the next expiry date and the name of the user currently logged in.

### Metered services

Click this button to open the dashboard for your metered services.

Metered services are services that are invoiced after you exceed a certain level/number of

* Storage space used
* Emails sent via Mailings
* Customer center logins
* Chat sessions started
* Form submissions

Administrators can keep track of exactly how much each service is used per month. Whenever your company exceeds the threshold, you are automatically invoiced for these services on your next monthly invoice. The threshold depends on the number of users. The more users you have, the higher the threshold will be.

### System notifications

This list shows status messages from the system and added [events][1]. Notifications of active imports, SAINT or freetext indexing, and so on. Select a notification in the list to display a description. You can keep track of events that are active in the system.

The **System events** tab consists of two parts:

* **Events**.
* **Description**, shows detailed information about the event currently selected under **Events**.

Under **System notifications** you will find the following columns:
