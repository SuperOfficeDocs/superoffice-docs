# Add a project type

[!include[Note difference](includes/different-edit-list-item-dialog.md)]

[!include[Edit list item](includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the list items are project types:

1. Enter the name of the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!include[Mandatory](includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

2. In the **Estimated time for this project process**, enter a duration for the project (number of weeks, days or months). When you create a new project of this project type, the end date is set relative to the time you enter here (today's date + estimated time).

3. In the **Statuses used for this project type** list, check off the statuses you want to include for the project type. This step is optional, but to link the project type to a project guide, you should check at least two statuses.

    [How to create a project status][2].

4. Check **This project type is linked to a guide** if you want all projects of this project type to follow a [project guide][3].

5. Optionally, select **Suggest moving the project to next status automatically**. When all follow-ups and documents for a status are completed, you will be asked if you want to go to the next status.

6. Enter a description of the project type.

7. Click **Save**. The project type is added as a separate item in the **Items** list. Repeat this procedure to add more project types.
