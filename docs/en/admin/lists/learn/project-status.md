# Add a project status

[!include[Edit list item](includes/edit-list-item.md)] when you are adding an item to the **Project - Status** list:

1. Enter the name of the item in the **Name** field. This will be displayed in the option list for the **Status** field in the **Project** screen in SuperOffice CRM.

    > [!include[Mandatory](includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

2. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

3. [!include[Save or cancel](includes/save-or-cancel.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a status that is linked to a project guide (via a project type), this may have consequences for using the project guide.
