# GUI - Web panel

You can have shortcuts to URL addresses in SuperOffice CRM, so that you can open them directly from within the program.

You define which URL addresses will be available to users in SuperOffice CRM in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

The items are displayed in the order you entered them. To change the order, select an item and move it up or down using the arrow buttons to the left of the list ( ![icon][img1] ![icon][img2] ).

After adding items, you can specify details for each individual item. You can specify:

* Which user groups the item is visible for (see [User group filtering][2]).
* Which  [heading][1] it will be displayed under.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Add items to the GUI - Web panel list][3]
