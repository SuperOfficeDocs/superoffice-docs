# GUI - Web panel

You can have shortcuts to URL addresses in SuperOffice CRM, so that you can open them directly from within the program.

You define which URL addresses will be available to users in SuperOffice CRM in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

The items are displayed in the order you entered them. To change the order, select an item and move it up or down using the arrow buttons to the left of the list (<i class="ph ph-arrow-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="ph ph-arrow-circle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

After adding items, you can specify details for each individual item. You can specify:

* Which [user groups the item is visible for][2].
* Which  [heading][1] it will be displayed under.

## The www tab

In the **www** tab, you can specify a shortcut to a URL address, to get information from other applications via a URL. The URL address can be specified using a template variable. The **www** tab can be displayed in several places in SuperOffice CRM, as defined in Settings and maintenance. If you click a shortcut, the linked URL address opens.

> [!TIP]
> In the **Labels** tab in the **Options** window in Settings and maintenance, you can specify a different name for this tab than **www**. You can also specify a different location in **GUI - Web panel**.

Here you can click **Open in separate window** to view the web page in a separate browser window.
