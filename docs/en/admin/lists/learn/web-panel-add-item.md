# Add items to the GUI - Web panel list

<details><summary>Is SuperOffice CRM for Web installed on an https site?</summary>

If SuperOffice CRM for Web is installed on an HTTPS site, web panels using HTTP URLs will not work. You must use HTTPS URLs.

You can open the URL in safe mode in your browser, but the site will then no longer be safe.

If SuperOffice CRM for Web is installed on an HTTP site, use "normal" HTTP URLs.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a URL address, it may be useful to use template variables for the active company, for example, to retrieve information from other applications via a URL. The URL address must specify parameters, as in this fictitious example: `http://www.comlist.com/data/indiv/detail.jsp?orgno=<orgn>`. orgn here is the template variable for the organization number, but other variables like company name &lt;name&gt;, company phone number &lt;cpho&gt;, contact name &lt;attn&gt;, can also be used.
