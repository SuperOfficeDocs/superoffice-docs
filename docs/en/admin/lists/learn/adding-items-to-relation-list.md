# Add items to the General - Relation list

[!include[Note difference](includes/different-edit-list-item-dialog.md)]

[!include[Edit list item](includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the list items are relations:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field. What you enter here is displayed in the **has relations** column on the **Relations** section tab in the Company screen. It should be a verb in the *active* form, for example, *owns*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!include[Mandatory](includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

2. Enter the passive form of the relation in the **Passive form** field. What you enter here is displayed in the **has relations** column on the **Relations** section tab in the Company screen. It should be a verb in the *passive* form, for example, *owned by*. See examples at the end of this section.

3. Under **This is a relationship between**, specify if the relationship refers to a company and/or a contact on the active and passive side respectively. These fields correspond to the fields in the **Relation** dialog.

4. Under **Example** you can see an example of what the relationship looks like in practice.

5. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.
