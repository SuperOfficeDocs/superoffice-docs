# Add items to the General - Relation list

The **Relations** section tab in the Company and Contact screens displays any connections (relations) existing between contacts. For example, information about ownership structure or about people who have been employed in different companies.

[!include[Note difference](includes/different-edit-list-item-dialog.md)]

[!include[Edit list item](includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the list items are relations:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field. What you enter here is displayed in the **has relations** column on the **Relations** section tab in the Company screen. It should be a verb in the *active* form, for example, *owns*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!include[Mandatory](includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

2. Enter the passive form of the relation in the **Passive form** field. What you enter here is displayed in the **has relations** column on the **Relations** section tab in the Company screen. It should be a verb in the *passive* form, for example, *owned by*. See examples at the end of this section.

3. Under **This is a relationship between**, specify if the relationship refers to a company and/or a contact on the active and passive side respectively. These fields correspond to the fields in the **Relation** dialog.

4. Under **Example** you can see an example of what the relationship looks like in practice.

5. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

6. [!include[Save or cancel](includes/save-or-cancel.md)]
