# Edit name and/or description of item

Every day you use different lists to save specific customer information. Examples of lists are: activity types, customer categories, business types, and many more.

The lists in SuperOffice CRM are designed to fit most businesses, but some companies may want to create their own. You can tailor each list in the system to meet your needs.

By changing the list of categories, for example, it will be easier for your users to adopt your CRM solution, because they will recognize the categories they are accustomed to.

SuperOffice CRM contains a lot of lists that you can customize. There are, by default, some items available in all lists. You can add new list items and deactivate unnecessary ones.

You can change the name or description of an item previously set up in Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the item changes if it is already in use in SuperOffice CRM. To avoid this, [delete the old item][1] instead and create a new one.
