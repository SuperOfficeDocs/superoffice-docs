# Add items to the Follow-up - Type list

[!include[Note difference](includes/different-edit-list-item-dialog.md)]

[!include[Edit list item](includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the items are follow-up types:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!include[Mandatory](includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

2. Click the ![icon][img1] arrow next to the **Type** field and select the required follow-up type from the list box.

3. In the **Direction** field, specify if the follow-up is outgoing or incoming by clicking the arrow and choosing from the list box.

4. In the **Color** field, choose which background color this follow-up type should have in the Diary screen. This setting will then apply across the organization.

5. In the **Intention** field, click the arrow and select one of the predefined options from the list box. These items are used in connection with status monitors in SuperOffice CRM (requires a licence for [SAINT][2]).

    > [!TIP]
    > You can create new options in addition to the predefined ones by adding them to the **Follow-up - Intention** list in Settings and maintenance. Follow the procedure under [Add items][2].

    * Check the **All day** option if you want it to be possible to select a duration of a whole day for the follow-up type in the follow-ups dialog in SuperOffice CRM.
    * Check the **Free** option if you want it to be possible to specify free and busy times for the follow-up type in the follow-ups dialog in SuperOffice CRM.
    * Check the **Publish** option if you want it to be possible to specify, in the follow-ups dialog in SuperOffice CRM, that the follow-up in question should be made available to external users.

6. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

7. [!include[Save or cancel](includes/save-or-cancel.md)]
