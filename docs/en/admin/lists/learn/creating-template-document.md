# Create a template document

You create a template as a document in an application which is linked to SuperOffice CRM, for example, a word-processing program. If you create the template in Word, you must save it as a normal document (with the file type **DOC** or **DOCX**), and not as a template (with the file type **DOT** or **DOTX**).

You can also create templates in HTML format, and use the SuperOffice HTML editor to edit the template.

**Steps:**

1. Start the required application.
2. Create a new document.
3. Insert the [template variables][1] you want to use in the template, for example, variables for name, address and telephone number.
4. Save the template document somewhere where you can find it easily again.

After you define a template and save it in the template folder, you must [link the template to SuperOffice CRM][2] to create documents from it.
