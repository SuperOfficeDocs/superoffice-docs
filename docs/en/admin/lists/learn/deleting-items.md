# Delete predefined and user-defined list items

1. [!include[Go to Lists](includes/goto-lists.md)]
2. [!include[Click arrow and select](includes/expand-list.md)] the required list.
3. Select the item to delete in the **Items** list.
4. Click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the screen. The item will be deleted from the list and will also no longer be displayed in the relevant list in SuperOffice CRM.
5. [!include[Save or cancel](includes/save-or-cancel.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The [deletion is not permanent even if you confirm it][1]. The name of the item will still be displayed in records in SuperOffice CRM that refer to it. This does not apply if you create a list and delete it before you saved it. In that case, the list cannot be undeleted.
