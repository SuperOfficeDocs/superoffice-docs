# Add items to the GUI - Application list

[!include[Note difference](includes/different-edit-list-item-dialog.md)]

[!include[Edit list item](includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the items are applications or similar:

> [!NOTE]
> Files or applications that must be run locally (for example, *.exe* files) are not accessible in SuperOffice CRM for Web.

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field. This name is displayed at the place where you add the application in SuperOffice CRM (see step 7 concerning the **Show** list box).

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!include[Mandatory](includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

1. Under **Add as**, select what the application will be added as:

    * **Button**: the application icon is displayed in the Navigator in SuperOffice CRM. Users can then open the application directly by clicking the icon in the Navigator.
    * **Menu item**: the user can access the application by clicking the **Tools** button ( ![icon][img2] ) in the Navigator and/or by selecting **Other applications** on the main menu (![icon][img1]) in SuperOffice CRM.
    * **Event**: the application is run when SuperOffice CRM opens or closes or on a local update (Travel). See step 8. You could, for example, run a synchronization program for a PDA when SuperOffice CRM closes.
    * **Task**: select an option in this list box to make the application accessible from the **Task** tab in the **Selection** screen or the **Task** buttons in various locations in SuperOffice CRM.

        <details><summary>Click here to find out more about the different options.</summary>

        The names in parenthesis indicate the section tab where the application is available.

        Examples:

        * **Sale selection (Sale)**: Once you open a sale selection in the **Selection** screen and the **Sales** section tab is enabled, the application is displayed as a task in the **Task** tab.
        * **Sale selection (Companies)**: Once you open a sale selection in the **Selection** screen and the **Companies** section tab is enabled, the application is displayed as a task in the **Task** tab.
        * **Sale selection (external)**: If your SuperOffice CRM installation is linked to a third-party application, other section tabs may be displayed for the different selections. You can then select, for example, **Sale selection (external)** to display the application as a task in the **Task** tab when you open a sale selection in the **Selection** screen and the third-party application section tab is active.

        Other options:

        * **Toolbar**: the application is displayed as an option on the toolbar. The users must configure the toolbar in SuperOffice CRM and choose to display the application.

        * **Dialog for follow-ups**: the application is displayed as an option under the **Task** button in the dialog for follow-ups.

        * **Document dialog**: the application is displayed as an option under the **Task** button in the selected dialog. The same option is available for the **Contact**, **Quote** and **Product** dialogs.

        </details>
