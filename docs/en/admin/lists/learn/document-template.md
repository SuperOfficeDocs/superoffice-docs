# Document - Template

[!include[Link to quote template docs](includes/learn-quote-templates.md)]

It is important for an organization's profile that letters, faxes and other documents have a distinctive and consistent appearance. This means that all documents sent out by the organization should use the same fonts, margins, logos and so on. By creating templates that are customized to your organization you ensure that your contacts can easily recognize your correspondence.

SuperOffice CRM is supplied with several [standard templates][2] that you can use immediately after installing the program.

You can also create your own templates in the applications you have chosen to use in conjunction with SuperOffice CRM (see [GUI - Application][3]). You do this by entering [template variables][1] in the template documents, which then retrieve information from corresponding fields in SuperOffice CRM when you write a document using a template you created.

## How to add a template document

1. [Add and define the document template][6] in Settings and maintenance.
1. Make the document template available to the requisite user groups. See [User group filtering][5].
