# GUI - Application

You can have shortcuts to external applications in SuperOffice CRM, so that you can open them directly from within SuperOffice CRM for Windows.

You define which URL addresses will be available to users in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> Files or applications that must be run locally (for example exe files) are not accessible in SuperOffice CRM for Web.

The items are displayed in the order you entered them. To change the order, select an item and move it up or down using the arrow buttons to the left of the list ( ![icon][img1] ![icon][img2] ).

After adding items, you can specify details for each individual item. You can specify:

* Which user groups the item is visible for (see [User group filtering][2]).
* Which [heading][1] it will be displayed under.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Add items to the GUI - Application list][3]
