# Organizing lists

SuperOffice CRM contains many default lists with even more list items. As you add your own (user-defined) lists and list items, it is a good idea to organize your lists. There are two main ways to organize lists in SuperOffice CRM:

* **Grouping:** Using headings in lists to categorize list items in 2 levels. Example: The **General - Resource** list can be grouped using two headings; *Equipment* and *Rooms*. See [Group items under headings][1].

* **User group filtering:** Making list items visible only to the user groups who actually use them. Example: The **Document - Template** list can be filtered so that quote templates are not visible to user groups that never send quotes. See [User group filtering][2].

In Settings and maintenance, you can specify for most predefined and all user-defined lists that they should be grouped.

[!include[Note](../includes/note-minimum-list-items.md)]

## Specify that a list should be grouped

1. [!include[Go to Lists](../includes/goto-lists.md)]
2. [!include[Click arrow and select](../includes/expand-list.md)] the required list.
3. Check **Use grouping and user group filtering for this list** at the upper right.

> [!NOTE]
> The grouping function is not available for some of the predefined lists (for example, the **General - User group** list). If a list cannot be grouped, this checkbox is disabled. [How to group items under headings][1].
