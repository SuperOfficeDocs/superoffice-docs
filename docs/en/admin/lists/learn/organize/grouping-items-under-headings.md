# Group items under headings

If you want a list with two levels, you must select headings for each individual item in the **Items** list in the **Lists** screen. Alternatively, you can go to the **Headings** tab to specify available items for specific headings. Both methods are described below.

[!include[Note](../includes/note-minimum-list-items.md)]

## Choose headings for a list item

1. Open the **Lists** screen.

2. [!include[Click arrow and select](../includes/expand-list.md)] the required list. Any headings already specified for the selected list are displayed in the **Headings** list at the lower right.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this field is empty, [add headings first][1].

3. Select the required item in the **Items** list.

4. Check **Use grouping and user group filtering for this list** in the upper right.

5. Check the box next to the required heading name in the **Headings** list to specify that the selected list item will be displayed under it. The box will then be marked with a tick (<i class="ph ph-check" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

    The changes are saved automatically.

> [!TIP]
> You can select several headings for one item.
