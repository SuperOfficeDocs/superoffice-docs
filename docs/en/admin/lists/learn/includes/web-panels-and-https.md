If SuperOffice CRM for Web is installed on an HTTPS site, web panels using HTTP URLs will not work. You must use HTTPS URLs.

You can open the URL in safe mode in your browser, but the site will then no longer be safe.

If SuperOffice CRM for Web is installed on an HTTP site, use "normal" HTTP URLs.
