# General - Country

In several places in SuperOffice CRM you can select a desired country from a selection list. The list of countries (and their flags) is obtained from the ISO standard list of countries. The list of countries is predefined in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance. You can, if required, edit the predefined countries or add a new one.
