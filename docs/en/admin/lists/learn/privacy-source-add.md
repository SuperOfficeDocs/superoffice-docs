# Add items to the Privacy - Source list

1. Enter the name of the item in the **Name** field.

2. Enter a unique identifier for the source in the **Key** field. This value will remain unique independent of database and is used by developers.

3. **Automatically send confirmation email to contact**: Select this option to send an automatic confirmation to new contacts when this source is used as a legal basis for their consent.

    An email address must be registered on this contact.

4. If you selected the option above, you must select a template for the confirmation to be sent to the contact.

    Only document templates with the option **Privacy email template** activated are available in the list. [How to add a document template][1].
