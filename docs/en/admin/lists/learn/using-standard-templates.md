# Use standard templates

SuperOffice CRM is supplied with a set of standard templates for both national and international use.

These templates are used when you create documents from SuperOffice CRM.

The templates contain variables which extract information from the SuperOffice database and enter it into the document automatically.

You can edit the templates that are supplied with SuperOffice CRM.

## Edit standard templates

You can edit the standard templates supplied with SuperOffice CRM and save them with your own names. Using the standard templates as a basis, you can, for example, change the font and font size, insert graphics and replace or add fields.

> [!NOTE]
> You must not change the file names of the system templates as this will prevent the functions included in them from working.

1. [!include[Go to Lists](includes/goto-lists.md)]
2. [!include[Click arrow and select](includes/expand-list.md)] **Document - Template**.
    All previously defined items for the selected list are displayed in the **Items** list.
3. Double-click the required item in the **Items** list.
4. In the dialog, click the **Edit** button. The document opens in the correct application.
5. Save the document with a new name to keep the original template intact, or with the same name to overwrite it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you save a standard template with a new name, you have created a new template. You must [link this template to SuperOffice CRM][1].
