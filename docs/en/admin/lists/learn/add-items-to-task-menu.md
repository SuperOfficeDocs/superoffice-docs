# Add items to the Task menu list

When you add an item to the **Task menu** list in Settings and maintenance, the Edit list item dialog is not the same as described under [Add items][2].

    > Do you want to add an item to a specialised list?
    Some list types are more specialised than those referred to in this procedure. [Specialised lists][3]

    * URL
        * Enter the **URL address** into the URL field.

> [!TIP]
> If you add a URL address, it may be useful to use template variables for the active company, for example, to retrieve information from other applications via an URL. The URL address must specify parameters, as in this fictitious example: `http://www.comlist.com/data/indiv/detail.jsp?orgno=<orgn>`. orgn here is the template variable for the organisation number, but other variables like company name &lt;name&gt;, company phone number &lt;cpho&gt;, contact name &lt;attn&gt;, can also be used.
