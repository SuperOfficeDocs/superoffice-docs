# User-defined lists

To get started, click the **Lists** button in the Navigator (<i class="ph ph-list-bullets" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

## Add user-defined list

1. Click the **Create list** button in the upper right of the screen.

1. Enter the required name of the list in the **Name** field. *(Mandatory)*

1. Optionally, type in a description of the list in the **Description** field.

1. Click **OK** to save the list.

The list is added to the **Lists** list. If you check the list in the list, the description is displayed at the top of the **Lists** screen.

As well as specifying a name and description for the list, you must [add items][1] to it.

## Edit a list's name and description

1. Select the required list from the list box at the top.

1. Click the **Edit list** button.

1. Type a new name for the list in the **Name** field.

1. Edit the description of the list, as required, in the **Description** field.

1. Click **OK** to save your changes.

## Delete user-defined list

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot delete lists that are predefined in SuperOffice CRM. If you select a predefined list, the **Delete list** button will not be displayed. Nor can you delete lists which are used in user-defined fields. In these cases, the **Delete list** button in the **Lists** tab is disabled.

1. Select the required list from the list box at the top.

1. Click the **Delete list** button.

1. Click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog.

    The list is deleted.
