# Update list items

## Edit name and/or description of item

Every day you use different lists to save specific customer information. Examples of lists are: activity types, customer categories, business types, and many more.

The lists in SuperOffice CRM are designed to fit most businesses, but some companies may want to create their own. You can tailor each list in the system to meet your needs.

By changing the list of categories, for example, it will be easier for your users to adopt your CRM solution, because they will recognize the categories they are accustomed to.

SuperOffice CRM contains a lot of lists that you can customize. There are, by default, some items available in all lists. You can add new list items and deactivate unnecessary ones.

You can change the name or description of an item previously set up in Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the item changes if it is already in use in SuperOffice CRM. To avoid this, [delete the old item](#delete) instead and create a new one.

### Steps

1. [!include[Go to Lists](learn/includes/goto-lists.md)]

2. [!include[Click arrow and select](learn/includes/expand-list.md)] the required list.

    All previously defined items for the selected list are displayed in the **Items** list. If you select a new user-defined list, the list is empty.

3. Double-click the required item in the **Items** list.

4. In the dialog, enter a new name and a description. *(Mandatory)*

5. [!include[Save or cancel](learn/includes/save-or-cancel.md)]

### Example - customize subscription types

According to many European laws that govern local marketing practices, a business is only allowed to send digital marketing messages to the people who have given you their permission to do so. Learn how to add and edit subscription types in this example.

By creating different subscription types for your mailings, you can send your target audiences relevant and expected communication at the right time and improve the results of your E-marketing campaigns.

After a contact is registered in SuperOffice CRM, this person can subscribe to the marketing communications they wish to receive. They can do this by setting their subscription preferences. Basically, you add the subscription types your company offers, and remove those you do not offer.

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete predefined and user-defined list items

1. [!include[Go to Lists](learn/includes/goto-lists.md)]
2. [!include[Click arrow and select](learn/includes/expand-list.md)] the required list.
3. Select the item to delete in the **Items** list.
4. Click the **Delete** button at the bottom of the screen. The item will be deleted from the list and will also no longer be displayed in the relevant list in SuperOffice CRM.
5. [!include[Save or cancel](learn/includes/save-or-cancel.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The [deletion is not permanent even if you confirm it][5]. The name of the item will still be displayed in records in SuperOffice CRM that refer to it. This does not apply if you create a list and delete it before you saved it. In that case, the list cannot be undeleted.
