    > Click the arrow next to the **To** box to open a list of possible time intervals. Using this list you can choose, for example, to show all reports defined for the next year, starting with the **From** date.

5. You now have the following options:

    * To show the reports for a specific group, select the required group in the **Groups** list. The members in the group will then be selected for you on the **Associates** list on the right.

    * To show reports for one or more associates, simply select the required people in the **Associates** list. To select several, hold down the **CTRL** key as you select the people you want.

    * To show your own reports, click the **Mine** button.

    * To show all reports for all groups and associates, click the **All** button.
