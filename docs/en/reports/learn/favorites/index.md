# Favourite reports

In the **Reports** screen you can save reports which you use a lot or have edited. You simply add them to the list of favourite reports. The report list contains the names of the reports and information about the selected report is shown on the right.

> [!NOTE]
> The list is empty until you define some favourite reports.

These favourite reports are in fact standard reports for which you have [changed the search criteria][4]. Favourite reports act as shortcuts to the search criteria which you normally use when running reports.

> [!TIP]
> You can bring up the list of favourite reports instantly by clicking the **Favourites** tab in the **Reports** screen, or by clicking the word **Reports** next to the **Reports** button in the Navigator and selecting **Favourites**.
