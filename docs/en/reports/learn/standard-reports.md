# Standard reports

In the **Reports** screen, you can also run standard reports of different types. These reports are sorted by type, and you bring them up on screen by clicking the tabs at the top of the **Reports** screen (see [Show report properties][1]).

SuperOffice CRM is supplied with multiple reports as standard, but an organization can also create its own reports in SuperOffice Reporter Studio, which is an optional add-on module. When you are using the **Reports** screen however, you will not notice any difference in where the reports come from, so here we treat them all as standard reports.

> [!TIP]
> You can save frequently-used standard reports as [favorite reports][2], to make them easier to access. Additionally you can edit standard reports and save them as favorites.

## Edit and delete standard reports

You can neither edit nor delete the standard reports themselves. What you can do however is to [save a standard report as a favorite report][3] and then [adjust the search criteria as you wish][4].
