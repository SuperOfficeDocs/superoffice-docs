# Run a report

Using your own favorite reports or the published reports in the **Reports** screen, you can generate reports containing data from SuperOffice CRM.

> [!NOTE]
> Report generation is based on the same access rights as SuperOffice CRM itself. This means that if there is something you do not have read rights for in SuperOffice CRM, this information will not be included in the reports you create.

When you want to run a report in the **Reports** screen, you can choose to view the report on-screen, print it to a printer, or save it as a file. In each of the last two cases, it is a good idea to view the report on-screen first, to make sure that it looks the way you want it to.

To [save a report as a document][1] (type = Report) in SuperOffice CRM, click the **Save** button in the **Reports** screen.
