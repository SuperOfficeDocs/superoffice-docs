# Search criteria for reports

The criteria list shows the various criteria which define what the report will contain. To create a sales report, for example, you can use a country and date as search criteria, so that the report shows all sales made in Norway after 01.01.2015.

In the **Reports** screen, you can [adjust the existing search criteria][1]. How you do this varies slightly according to the type of criteria involved. Criteria are edited in their own dialog and the appearance of this dialog changes depending on the criterion you selected. The criteria you can choose from vary according to the tab and report you have selected.

> [!NOTE]
> Search criteria in the **Field** list box are predefined and you can neither add to nor delete them. This can be done in SuperOffice Reporter Studio only.

If you change the search criteria in a standard report, your changes are only temporary: If you move on to another standard report, the changes you made in the first one are lost. However, to keep the search criteria you entered, you can save the standard report whose criteria you amended as a [favorite report][3].
