# Add search criteria to reports

You can add more search criteria to a report. If you add criteria to a standard report, you must [save it as a favorite report][1] to keep the changes in the report.

1. [!include[How to-goto-reports](../includes/goto-reports.md)]
2. Select a tab. The reports are displayed in the report list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is not recommended that you run reports without specifying search criteria, as this may generate extremely large reports and result in time-consuming processing.

3. Click the **Add** button at the bottom of the criteria list. The **Add/edit search criteria** dialog appears.
4. [Enter the required search criteria][2].

    > [!NOTE]
    > The criteria you can choose from vary according to the tab and report you selected.

5. Click **OK** at the bottom of the **Add/edit search criteria** dialog when you are done.
