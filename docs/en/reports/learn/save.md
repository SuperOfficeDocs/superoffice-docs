# Save reports as files

You can save generated reports as documents, so they can later be opened from the report archive or from the **Activities** section tab. The reports are saved as PDFs.

> [!NOTE]
> Saving reports as files is managed slightly differently for cross table reports than for other types. See [Save cross table reports as files][2].

1. Click **Create**. The file is opened in the default PDF viewer and simultaneously saved in SuperOffice CRM.

## Manage saved reports

The report archive (the **Documents** section tab) at the bottom of the **Reports** screen allows you to open, delete and filter saved reports. You can sort the reports in the report archive by clicking on the individual column headings.
