# Preview the reports

The preview window lets you see what a print-out will look like before it is sent to the printer. The window is displayed when you click the **Preview** button under the criteria list in the **Reports** screen. The preview window contains options for displaying, navigating, printing and saving.

> [!NOTE]
> This works slightly differently for crosstables and labels which you can display via the **Reports** screen.
