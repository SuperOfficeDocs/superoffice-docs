# Preview the reports

The preview window lets you see what a print-out will look like before it is sent to the printer. The window is displayed when you click the **Preview** button under the criteria list in the **Reports** screen. The preview window contains options for displaying, navigating, printing and saving.

How this works varies slightly from report type to report type. To display cross table reports or label reports, see the topics below:

* [Display cross tables][1]
* [Display labels][2]

> [!TIP]
> If you are not sure which report type you have, check the thumbnail at the upper right of the **Reports** screen. [How][3].

1. Select the required report.

1. Click the **Preview** button under the criteria list. A PDF is generated in your browser.

[!include[Open PDF](includes/step-open-pdf.md)]

You can save the PDF file from the PDF viewer, so you can open it later.
