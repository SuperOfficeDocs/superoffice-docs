# Preview report

The preview window lets you see what a print-out will look like before it is sent to the printer. The window is displayed when you click the **Preview** button under the criteria list in the **Reports** screen. The preview window contains options for displaying, navigating, printing, and saving.

How this works varies slightly from report type to report type. If you are not sure which report type you have, [check the thumbnail][3] at the upper right of the **Reports** screen.

| Report type | Steps |
|---|---|
| Text, list, group list, calendar | Click **Preview**. See details below.|
| Label | Click **Preview** and [choose label format][2]. |
| Cross table | [How to display cross tables][1]
