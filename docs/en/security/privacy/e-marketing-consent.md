# GDPR e-marketing consent

The GDPR states that an individual has the right to object to receiving marketing materials.

For this reason, SuperOffice enables companies to store and track the consent forÂ e-marketing as a specific purpose, meaning that the company wants to send e-marketing mailings to a person and tracks the consent for doing so. In this way, the company can keep track of if and when consent has been withdrawn.

In addition, in several European countries, local marketing laws require the legal basis for this purpose to be an **explicit consent** given by the individual and not set by the company. This applies especially when sending marketing materials to prospects. If your application is used for sending out e-marketing mailings, then you must make sure you check for the contact person's e-marketing consent.
