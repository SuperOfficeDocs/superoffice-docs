# Send privacy confirmation email

From the **Contact** screen you can resend the privacy confirmation email to a contact. The privacy confirmation email is normally sent automatically to a contact when they are registered in SuperOffice. With this function you can send the confirmation email to existing contacts that have never received the confirmation email.

## What does this email contain?

The privacy confirmation email will normally inform the contact of the following:

* Their information was stored in SuperOffice
* What type of information was stored
* What the information is used for (purpose)
* That they can withdraw consent whenever they like
* That the information is secure and will not be shared

The email can also contain a link to a customer centre where the contact can manage subscriptions and consent. The link is valid for 21 days by default.
