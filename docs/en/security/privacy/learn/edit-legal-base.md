# Edit privacy settings for a contact

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires functional rights. Without the proper functional rights, you can only set **E-marketing** to on or off.

As a company, you collect, store and handle people's personal data. Under the GDPR, you now need to have a lawful reason for why you want to store this information.

SuperOffice CRM has a feature called Consent management, that is designed to help you document when, how and why you want to register certain personal data in your CRM solution.

Every time a person is registered in your SuperOffice CRM database, the consent they gave to save their details is also registered. This allows you to manage and track exactly which consent you have received from which person, at all times.

[!include[Need concent](includes/why-consent.md)]

## Definitions

* **Consent**: You must get the permission from a person to store and process their personal data.

* **Purpose**: Why you are storing and processing a person's data. Examples: **Sales and service** and ***E-marketing**. For each purpose you must document the following:

  * **Legal basis**: The legal basis for storing and processing a person's data.
  * **Source**: How and where you obtained the person's consent.

## Available purposes

* **Sales and service**: This purpose *must* have a legal basis and source, because you need a person's consent to lawfully process and store their personal data in SuperOffice.

* **E-marketing**: You need a person's permission to send them e-marketing material. This purpose can also be set by using the **E-marketing** button in the **Interests** tab.

* Additional purposes can be added from Settings and maintenance.
