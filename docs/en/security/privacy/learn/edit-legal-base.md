# Edit privacy settings for a contact

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires functional rights. Without the proper functional rights, you can only set **E-marketing** to on or off.

[!include[Need concent](includes/why-consent.md)]

## Definitions

* **Consent**: You must get the permission from a person to store and process their personal data.

* **Purpose**: Why you are storing and processing a person's data. Examples: **Sales and service** and ***E-marketing**. For each purpose you must document the following:

  * **Legal basis**: The legal basis for storing and processing a person's data.
  * **Source**: How and where you obtained the person's consent.

## Available purposes

* **Sales and service**: This purpose *must* have a legal basis and source, since you need a person's consent to lawfully process and store their personal data in SuperOffice.

* **E-marketing**: You need a person's permission to send them e-marketing material. This purpose can also be set by using the **E-marketing** button in the **Interests** tab.

* Additional purposes can be added from Settings and maintenance.
