# Set up privacy settings for GDPR - Add purpose

Find out how to add and edit purposes for processing personal data, activate default settings for the Legal Basis, and activate the E-marketing privacy settings in mailings.

## Steps

1. Go to Settings and maintenance and click the **Privacy** button in the Navigator (<i class="ph ph-shield" aria-hidden="true"></i>).

1. Click **Add** below the list of purposes.

1. In the **Add purpose** dialog, edit the following fields:

    * **Purpose name**: Enter a descriptive name for the purpose. It should be easy to understand and unambiguous.

    * **Description**: Enter a short description and privacy statement for the customers, explaining why you are asking for their consent and what the information will be used for.

    * **Purpose ID**: An ID is automatically generated from the name of the purpose, but you can edit the ID later. Please note that some IDs are reserved.

    * **Active**: Used to activate this purpose and make it visible to users.

    * **External privacy statement**: The name/title of the privacy statement link. This text is used on a web page where customers can manage their subscriptions.

    * **External privacy statement URL**: The URL/link to the web page for the privacy statement.

    * **Approval text**: Enter the text that the customers must click to give their consent. Examples: "I accept these terms" or "Yes, sign me up ...".

    * **External description in Customer Centre**: Enter the description text for this purpose to be displayed in Customer Centre. The text should contain:

        * Why you need to store/process the customer's data
        * Which data you are storing/processing
        * Confirmation the data will not be shared with other parties and is stored securely
        * Information about how they can change or withdraw consent at any time
