# GDPR consent management

To meet the GDPR requirements for documenting consents, we provide the Consent Management feature in SuperOffice CRM.

You can and should keep a record of:

* **purpose:** the *reason why* they want to store personal information
* **legal basis:** the lawfulness of processing information
* **privacy source:** *how* the personal information entered SuperOffice
* the *date and time*
* *who* entered the information

The default purpose in SuperOffice is called **Sales and service**. All new contacts stored in SuperOffice are assigned this purpose with the legal base as **legitimate interest** unless the company has changed the default setting. The source is also automatically set
