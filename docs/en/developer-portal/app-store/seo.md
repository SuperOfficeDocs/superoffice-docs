# Improve SEO

Both your vendor page and each app-specific product page in the App Store have settings for search engine optimization (SEO).

You can add or change the following in the Developer Portal:

| Setting | Where to change it |
|---|---|
| Search-engine-friendly name (company) | Partner > Settings > Partner profile |
| Search-engine-friendly name (app) | App page > Settings |
| Meta description (company) | Partner > App Store information > Partner profile |
| Meta description (app) | App page > App Store information > SEO |
| Meta keywords (app) | App page > App Store information > SEO |

A **search-engine-friendly name** is:

* short
* keyword-rich
* lower-case
* using dashes to indicate space
* not containing characters that aren't valid in web addresses
* not containing unimportant words

A **meta description** is a brief summary of a web page and should give the user an idea of the content.
It is placed in the `<head>` HTML tag and displayed in search engine results pages and can impact the click-through rate (CTR).

It should:

* use only alphanumeric characters
* be between 50 and 160 characters: long enough to be sufficiently descriptive yet avoid getting truncated by the search engine
* use short sentences
* contain your target keywords
* be accurate, compelling, and pertinent to the search

**Meta keywords** range from single words to complex phrases and are used to inform website content in a more focused way than the description.
