# Standard apps for SuperOffice Online

[!include[Standard vs. custom apps](../includes/std-vs-custom-app.md)]

Standard [applications][1] are owned by, operated by, and the responsibility of SuperOffice partners. You become a cloud partner when you sign our sub-DPA, which you need to publish your standard application to the App Store.

All applications begin in our [sandbox environment][2]. Standard applications must pass our [certification][3] and [security evaluation][4] by Telenor Cyberdefense. After that, you may list your application in our App Store.

> [!NOTE]
> The Telenor Cyberdefense security evaluation is a mandatory part of our certification program.
