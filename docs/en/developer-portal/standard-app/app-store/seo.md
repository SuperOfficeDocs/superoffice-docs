# Improve SEO

Both your vendor page and each app-specific product page in the App Store have settings for search engine optimization (SEO).

You can add or change the following in the Developer Portal:

| Setting | Where to change it |
|---|---|
| Search-engine-friendly name (company) | Partner > Settings |
| Search-engine-friendly name (app) | App page > Settings |
| Meta description (company) | Partner > App Store information > Partner profile |
| Meta description (app) | App page > App Store information > SEO |
| Meta keywords (app) | App page > App Store information > SEO |

A **search-engine-friendly name** is:

* Short
* Keyword-rich
* Lower-case
* Using dashes to indicate space
* Not containing characters that aren't valid in web addresses
* Not containing unimportant words

A **meta description** is a brief summary of a web page and should give the user an idea of the content.
It is placed in the `<head>` HTML tag and displayed in search engine results pages and can impact the click-through rate (CTR).

It should:

* Use only alphanumeric characters
* Be between 50 and 160 characters: long enough to be sufficiently descriptive yet avoid getting truncated by the search engine
* Use short sentences
* Contain your target keywords
* Be accurate, compelling, and pertinent to the search

**Meta keywords** range from single words to complex phrases and are used to inform website content in a more focused way than the description.
