# The App Store marketplace

The SuperOffice App Store is where SuperOffice customers find and buy applications that expand their CRM solutions to solve relevant business needs.

Customers can browse the store to find a range of applications made available from both SuperOffice and our partners.

## Open to all SuperOffice CRM Online customers

The SuperOffice App Store is transparent and open to any applications that represent a clear business value to your customers and users, SuperOffice, and partners.

* Anonymous users may browse the marketplace (without login)
* Signed-in users can view their purchased and installed applications
* Signed-in users must have an active subscription to SuperOffice CRM Online to buy an application

### Marketplace, not a webshop

SuperOffice will not bill, [provision][1], or host partner applications. Instead, the App Store redirects to our partners' websites where customers buy directly from the partner.

## Partner profile pages

Each vendor that chooses to publish one or more standard applications to the App Store gets a **partner profile page**. For an example, see [SuperOffice AS in the App Store][2].

On this page, visitors learn more about who developed the application, and they can visit the partner's website for more information.

The page also lists all applications by this vendor with links to pages with details for each application.

## App detail pages

This page shows all the application's details. At the top, visitors can see the application name, the green **Install/Sign-up** button, and a one-line header introducing the app.

* A general description
* Pricing
* The terms
* How to install
* What is new

> [!NOTE]
> This price will show only under an application's home page image, and only if it is not marked as free.

Visitors can also see the category and language of the application and find out how to get support.

### Market availability

All SuperOffice customers can visit the App Store. There are no geographical limitations when viewing Apps. However, it could be that an application is not suitable for specific markets. For example, BankID for proving identity doesn't work in the Benelux.

## <a id="get-noticed"></a>How to get noticed in the App Store

Catching the customers' attention and interest becomes harder as the applications in the SuperOffice App Store grow in number.

Your App Store entry aims to trigger the interest, and your webshop needs to secure the purchase. This means that you sit in the driver's seat for how you want your company, your application, and your services to be presented.

### Stand out and be understood

1. Stand out from the crowd: create a name and **visual identity** that lets customers quickly identify your application as helpful.
2. Describe your application in a way that lets everyone understand what it does.
    * Avoid technical terms (unless they are necessary) so that a business person can identify the benefits you provide. If you need to include technical information, for example when listing the requirements, keep it as simple as possible.
3. Include high-quality **images** that show the user what your application is about and that support the descriptive text.

    * [How to upload the media files][3]

### Provide great customer experiences

To get those customers' **reviews**, it is very important not only to deliver a good quality product, but to invest in the description, sales material, and not least the **on-boarding** experience.

A lot of this will depend upon how you present your application in the App Store, but mostly how you present yourself when the user clicks and gets to your webshop.

1. Invest in the onboarding experience. Make it easy to buy and start using your application.
2. Automate the [provisioning][1].
3. Provide helpful videos, FAQs, and support services.

### Get customer reviews

Ask customers to rate your application We all look for recommendations and references when we make a purchase.

You can include customer statements in the text and/or links to your customer-reference page if you have one.

In the future, we will make it possible for customers to review and rate your application in the SuperOffice marketplace.
