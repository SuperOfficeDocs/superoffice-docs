# User guide

While most of the App Store information aims to hook new customers, you also need to provide a guide they can follow after deciding on your application.

## How to install

This information is shown on the **How to install** tab in the App Store.

4. Specify additional requirements: List all system requirements as bullet points. If there are none, specify "No additional system requirements".
