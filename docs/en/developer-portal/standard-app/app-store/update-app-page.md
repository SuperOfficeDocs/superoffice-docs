# Update app-specific page

The information shown on your app-specific product pages in the App Store comes from:

* Application settings
* App Store information

<!-- markdownlint-disable DOCSMD007 -->
> [!TIP]
> [!include[Link to application settings](../includes/see-app-settings.md)]
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

## Update application settings

1. In your application page, select **Settings** from the left menu or click the **Edit** button.

1. To update the technical contact person, click **Clear** and choose another contact by email address.

    [!include[User sources](../../partner/includes/note-users-collection.md)]

1. To receive error emails at different or additional email addresses, scroll to the bottom and enter one or more addresses in the **Error reporting emails** field.

    The addresses must be separated with a semicolon ( ; ), no spaces.

1. Click **Save Settings**.

## Update App Store information

> [!TIP]
> When you release a new version of your application, your App Store listing can include a **What's new** entry and we can help boost visibility.
>
> Optionally include new images, such as screenshots from your application.

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your application page.
1. Select **App Store information** from the left menu.
1. [Create a new version.][3]
1. Go through each sub-section and fill in the information.

    * [Description][5]

        > [!TIP]
        > Use an online counter to [count the number of characters or words][6].

    * [SEO][1]
    * [Prices and terms][7]
    * [How to install][8]
    * [Links][9]
    * [Image and videos][2]

1. Click **Save Settings**.

### Required information

Most fields are mandatory and must be filled out before you click **Request to Publish**. However, the App Store information can be edited and saved incrementally. Missing information is highlighted and color coded:

* Red - mandatory and must be filled before saving.
* Orange - mandatory for the published version but can be omitted when saving a draft.

When you click **Save Settings**, the confirmation dialog lists the fields needing attention.

## Verify your changes

1. Review your listing in the SOD App Store.

    > [!TIP]
    > Click the eye icon on a version to preview the published app store information in the [SOD App Store][10]. This is a shortcut to `https://appstore-sod.superoffice.com/PARTNER-NAME/APP-NAME`.

2. Fix issues in the Developer Portal if necessary.

## Request to publish

When you are happy with how it looks, return to your partner page in the Developer Portal:

1. Select **Overview** from the left menu.
2. In the **App Store** section, click the **Request to Publish** button.

> [!NOTE]
> The App Store information is only the commercial side of releasing an application.
>
> When you list an application for the first time, you must also prepare and request to publish the configuration.
