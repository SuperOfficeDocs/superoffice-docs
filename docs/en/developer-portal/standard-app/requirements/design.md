# Requirements for user UI and design

Following this style guide will ensure that the application integrates seamlessly with SuperOffice and other partner products. It will be experienced as a member of a product family.

Our experience is that **simple is better and less is more**. However, to make it simple for the user often means (a lot) more work for the programmer.

The importance of providing the same look & feel is often underestimated by programmers when integrating two different applications.

These requirements are not applicable if the application has no user interaction.

## Requirements

* The GUI of your application must adopt the graphical look from SuperOffice CRM when your application adds web panels or other visual interfaces directly in the SuperOffice application.

## Guidance

Check out our [best practices][1].

GUI elements that don't have a SuperOffice CRM graphical look are permitted as long as the host application is visible outside SuperOffice CRM Online.
