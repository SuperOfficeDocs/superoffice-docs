# Register a mirroring app

## About this template

This template creates a [database mirroring][6] app configuration for one specific customer. It will ask for the public endpoint of your mirroring service URL.

## Required licenses

All custom apps using database mirroring must have a subscription to the **Database Mirroring Service** [Development product][5].

Custom apps may only be used by a customer tenant who have the [Developer Tools license][4].

## Create app

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.

2. In the **Applications** section, click **Create App**.

3. Choose the **Custom database mirror app** template. Click **Next**.

4. Enter the name of your application. Use **Data mirroring for *Company name*** as the application name. Click **Next**.

5. Enter the URL of the integration endpoint.

    Select Off/On to activate the endpoint.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the endpoint is not yet ready, you may change configuration later.
