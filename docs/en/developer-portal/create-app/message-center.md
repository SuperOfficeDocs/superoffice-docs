# Messaging Center

The Messaging Center is a communication channel for developer portal related support information. It only includes support requests from:

* Request to publish events.
  * Application configuration.
  * AppStore information.
  * Partner page information.
* Feedback submitted from the AppStore **Report a problem** link.
* Support tickets created from the Failures details page.
* Your emails sent to `[appdev|appstore]@superoffice.com`.
  > [!CAUTION]
  > A problem might occur if you use a different email address than the one used to sign in to the Developer Portal, or it is a duplicate in SuperOffice.
* Notifications about developer portal changes.

> [!NOTE]
> The Messaging Center is not a support channel. For support, contact [SuperOffice Support][1].

## At a glance

The Messaging Center is located in the upper right-hand corner of the developer portal.

The messages are organized into three categories:

* **Waiting For SuperOffice** - Messages you have sent to SuperOffice.
* **Open** - Messages waiting for your response.
* **Closed** - Messages that have been resolved.

To reply to a message, you must either:

* Click the ticket ID and use the SuperOffice Customer Center.
