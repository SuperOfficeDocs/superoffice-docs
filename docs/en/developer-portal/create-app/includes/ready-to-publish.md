When you think it is ready in SOD, you can request to publish to Stage. This starts the [certification][1] or [validation][2] process, so read the guidelines and be prepared to follow up.

The SuperOffice app manager or App Store manager will reject or approve.

Remember to pick up application keys for all required environments **before** you request to publish.

For custom applications, when you request publish to Stage, we will automatically publish directly to production when approved.
