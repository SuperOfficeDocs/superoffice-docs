# CORS and redirection URLs

The [redirection endpoints][1] are specified and whitelisted when you register the application idea. When the app configuration is published to Stage or Production you may no longer make changes to them.

> [!NOTE]
> To add new CORS or redirect URLs in Stage or Production, create a [new version][5].

All changes to whitelisted URLs on a standard app have be approved SuperOffice.

Types of URLs:

* Default redirect URL
* Allowed redirect URLs
* Allowed postLogout redirect URLs
* CORS URLs

> [!NOTE]
> All URLs can optionally be configured per environment.
>
> You can list multiple of each type (except default).
>
> Consider if whitelisting is sufficient or you need a CORS redirect.

## Pre-requisites

* You have registered your application idea
* You are (or will be) handling web service requests at the new endpoints
