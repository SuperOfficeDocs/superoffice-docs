# Update endpoints

Which SuperOffice endpoints you get access to by default depend on the template you selected when registering the application. [See list of default configuration.][1] We highly recommend that all new apps use our **WebAPI**.

## What can I change?

You can add, remove, and update information about endpoints hosted by you that SuperOffice will send data to:

* ERP sync
* Quote connector
* Database mirror
* [Push notifications][7]
* [CORS and redirection URLs][6]

These are all part of your **application configuration**.

To get access to additional SuperOffice API endpoints or RESTful agents, you need to contact us.

## Steps

1. In the [Developer Portal][3], go to your application page.

1. Select **Configuration** from the left menu.

1. Select the **Integration settings** tab.

1. Update values in the appropriate **Endpoint** field. Optionally, choose different values per environment.

    [!include[Has integration?](../../includes/has-integration.md)]

1. Click **Save Settings**.

1. When done, [request to publish the configuration][2].
