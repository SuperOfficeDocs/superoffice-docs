# New certificate

The certificates in your application configuration are **RSA encryption keys**. You need the private key to [sign system user tokens][2] in server-to-server applications and database mirroring.

The Developer Portal stores your public key. However, you must store the private key.

[!include[How to replace value](includes/note-clear-to-replace.md)]

## How to

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->
[!include[Go to the app page](../../includes/go-to-app-page.md)]
<!-- List starts in the include. Next line MUST be 2. -->
2. Select **Configuration** > **Authentication**.

3. Click **New Certificate**.

    ![New Certificate dialog -screenshot][img2]

4. Enter a description and expiration, and then click **Add**.

    ![Certificates -screenshot][img3]

    [!include[Expiration ignored](includes/note-expiration.md)]

5. Store the **private key** somewhere safe! You can't look it up in the Developer Portal later.

6. Click **Save Settings**.

7. Request to publish the new configuration.
