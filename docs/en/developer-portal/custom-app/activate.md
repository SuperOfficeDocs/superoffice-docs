# First-time activation

Congratulations, your custom application is ready!

By activating a custom application, the owner of the tenant agrees to [subscribe to Development Tools][2] (formerly Expander Services).

## First-time activation

The first-time activation starts after your [application passes validation][1]. You don't need to trigger this step.

1. We will publish your application from SOD to the production environment.
2. The user currently signed in to the Developer Portal will receive an automatic email asking for the customer name and customer ID in CRM Online. This is found under **Help > About** when signed in to `online.superoffice.com`.
    If you as the application developer is not an employee of the customer, please forward this email to the customer and have then confirm to us that they want us to activate this application on their tenant (SuperOffice installation).
3. You contact the customer to initiate the [application setup][3].

## Request application changes

You can [change the application configuration][5] in the Developer Portal.
