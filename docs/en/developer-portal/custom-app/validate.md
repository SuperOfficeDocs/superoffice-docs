# Get your custom app validated and live

Your custom application is almost ready. Before we go live, we need to ensure that it can be safely activated in SuperOffice CRM Online.

## Pre-requisites

* Redirect URL is secure
* You have gone through the [validation checklist][1]
* You have appointed a designated technical contact who will be available during the validation test period

## Validate

1. [Request to publish configuration in the Developer Portal][3].
2. Provide additional info and clarify questions while we run the validation test in SOD.

    [!include[List of info](../includes/list-of-test-period-info.md)]

3. Fix issues if necessary.
4. [After your app passes validation, we will activate it][2].
