# Update endpoints

Which SuperOffice endpoints you get access to by default depend on the template you selected when registering the application. [See list of default configuration.][1] We highly recommend that all new apps use our **WebAPI**.

## What can I change?

You can add, remove, and update information about endpoints hosted by you that SuperOffice will send data to:

* ERP sync
* Quote connector
* Database mirror
* Push notifications
* Redirection

These are all part of your **application configuration**.

To get access to additional SuperOffice API endpoints or RESTful agents, you need to contact us.

## How to change configuration

1. In the [Developer Portal][3], go to your application page.
2. Select **Configuration** from the left menu.
3. Turn on **Advanced** (next to the left menu, between the list of versions and the client ID).
