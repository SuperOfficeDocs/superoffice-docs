# Find out who your customers are

You can check which customers that have authorized a specific app and get a list of all customers for your company. The information is shown the Developer Portal per environment (SOD, Stage, Production). We do not yet show you if they are actively using the app.

> New app authorizations do not show up immediately in the portal. The information is synchronized every hour. Be patient, and check again later.
