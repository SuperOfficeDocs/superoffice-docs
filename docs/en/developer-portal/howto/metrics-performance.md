# Check application API performance

Metered API calls come from applications that are not part of the SuperOffice standard products.

## At a glance

The **API Performance tab** shows API-level application performance for one specific application.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->
[!include[Go to the app page](../includes/go-to-app-page.md)]
<!-- List starts in the include. Next line MUST be 2. -->

2. Select **API metrics**, then select **API Usage** tab.

3. Select a time range interval (days, weeks, or months).

4. Click through the environment specific buttons.
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

### Columns

| Type of usage | Description |
|---|---|
| Operation Name | The URL endpoint. |
| Count | The number of API invocations to the endpoint. |
| Record Count | The number of database records selected by the API invocation. |
| Duration (AVG) | The average number number of milliseconds elapsed for each of all API invocations. |

> [!TIP]
> Click on a row to observe the samples (individual invocations) related to the endpoint.

## Filter by sample

* To see the request details, select one of the samples from the samples list.

 > [!NOTE]
 > The left side samples column contains each invocation for the endpoint. The center column contains the endpoint and the column on the right contains the invocation details.

* To return to the API Performance list, click the X in the upper right-hand corner.

## Improve app performance

Leverage our [best practices for online app development][2] to both boost your application's performance and reduce its API usage. Both [cashing][3] and [search][4] have a huge impact.

During development, following the statistics in SOD day-by-day can provide valuable insight into the impact of your improvements.
