# Check exceptions from your app's API calls

SuperOffice logs application behavior to Application Insights. In the Developer Portal, you can monitor and analyze your application's failed requests to our APIs and exceptions thrown.

* Exceptions originate in the SuperOffice file set.
* Failed *inbound* requests are requests from your app to a SuperOffice API endpoint.
* Failed *outbound* requests are not yet supported.

## At a glance

The **app page** shows application failures for one specific application.
