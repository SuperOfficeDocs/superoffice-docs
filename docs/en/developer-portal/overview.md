# Developer Portal

The [SuperOffice Developer Portal][6] contains a set of self-serve tools that developers can use to manage their access to SuperOffice Online APIs.

![SuperOffice Developer Portal start page for a partner -screenshot][img1]

In the portal, you have the opportunity to:

* Register and manage your SuperOffice Apps, and the authentication keys and tokens that they use.
* Manage your endpoint access requirements and integrations integration services endpoints.
* Learn more about different endpoints and features available.
* Explore API metrics, exceptions, and failed requests for your apps.
* With elevated privileges within your organization, you can manage users and their Developer Portal access.

> [!NOTE]
> The Developer Portal handles the application workflows. However, communication between you and SuperOffice goes through Service.

## How the portal is organized

The Developer Portal has three main areas:

* The Top bar
* The Navigator (left side)
* The content area

### The Top bar

![SuperOffice Developer Portal Top bar -screenshot][img2]

The Top bar (green with the SuperOffice logo) is always present and gives you quick access to:

* A list of your apps
* Your partner page
* SuperOffice Docs
* The forums on our Help Center and Community
* The personal menu, where you access your profile and can sign out

### The Navigator

The Navigator lets you move between the main sections of your partner and app pages. The items depend on the context:

Clicking a section opens it in the content area.

### The content area

The content area is where you view and update information. Some pages have one or more labelled groups. For example, compare the **Application Settings** below with the **Partner Overview** at the top of this page.

Other pages have subsections with their own navigator.

> [!NOTE]
> When you click **Save Settings** it applies to all changes on the page, across all subsections. The scope is determined by the left-most Navigator.

## Key areas and concepts

When you sign in to the Developer Portal, you either represent SuperOffice or a third-party organization hereafter referred to as **a partner**. SuperOffice is responsible for the SuperOffice CRM Online service and the partner is responsible for creating apps customizing the core service.

### Application

[!include[Application defined](../apps/includes/def-app.md)]

[!include[Standard vs. custom apps](../apps/includes/std-vs-custom-app.md)]

[Learn more about applications][3]

### Partner

A partner may own and/or develop applications.

[!include[Many apps](includes/note-more-than-8-apps.md)]

Anyone may [register as a CRM Online developer][1] and the first person who register for a new company will trigger the creation of a partner.

You see only the partners you belong to. If you have a role in multiple partners, you choose one as your current context.

A partner can have users with different roles:

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| Administrator | Manages own users and their permissions |
| Developer | Develops apps and configures everything related to security for those apps |
| Marketing | Manages content shown in the App Store |

> [!NOTE]
> SuperOffice employees also have different roles, such as the App Manager and Online Operations.

### User

[!include[ALT](includes/def-dp-user.md)]

The first person (user) assigned to a partner is commonly the administrator of that partner inside the portal. The administrator can add additional users.

### Settings

Both partners and applications have settings. These are essential information such as name and contact persons.

### Configuration

Each application has a configuration, including client ID and secret, certificates, redirection URLs, and endpoints. The initial configuration is added when you [register the application][4]. You can update and test the configuration in SOD and when you are ready, request approval to go live.

### App Store information

Both partners and standard applications have App Store information. This is your partner profile page
and one or more app-specific product pages shown in the SuperOffice App Store.

If your company develops custom applications only, you can ignore the **App Store information** section. Likewise, this section is hidden on the app page of all custom apps.
