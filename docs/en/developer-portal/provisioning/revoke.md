# Revoke access given to standard app

Revoking access to an application is a manual procedure. It will sever the connection between the application and a database tenant. It will not remove any data from the database.

The revocation must be done by the customer's tenant administrator.

1. Sign in to the [App Store][1].
2. Go to **Installed apps** and locate the application you want to revoke access to.
3. Click **Uninstall** to start the process to remove the app's access to your SuperOffice CRM. Only a tenant user with administrator rights will see this button.
4. If provided by the partner, use the application's **Uninstall** to remove the configuration (such as user-defined fields and web panels).
