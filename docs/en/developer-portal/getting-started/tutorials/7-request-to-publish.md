## Understanding the publication process  

SuperOffice requires all applications to go through a **publishing approval process** before they can be used in production.  

There are two types of publishing requests:  

1. **Application configuration publication**  
   * Required for **all applications** (both standard and custom)  
   * Moves your app from **SOD to Stage or Production**  

2. **App Store information publication**  
   * Required for **standard applications** that will be available in the **SuperOffice App Store**  
   * Includes **marketing content, pricing, and support details**  

ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** [Request to publish process](request-to-publish.md)

## Preparing your application for publication  

Before requesting publication, ensure that:  

* **Your application is fully tested** in the **SOD environment**  
* **All API endpoints and authentication flows** are working correctly  
* **Any required licenses or certificates** are in place  
* **You have completed the necessary documentation** (for standard apps)  

### **Final testing checklist**  

1. **Run a complete test of all features** in the SOD environment  
2. **Verify that your application follows SuperOffice security guidelines**  
3. **Check your API request and response logs** for errors  
4. **Ensure all redirect URLs and integration points are correctly set**

## Requesting to publish your application configuration  

Once your application is ready, you can request to **publish the configuration**.  

### **Step-by-step instructions:**  

1. **Log in to the SuperOffice developer portal**  
2. **Go to your application's page**  
3. **Select the "Configuration" section**  
4. **Click the "Request to publish" button**  

After submitting, the version will be marked as **pending review**, and SuperOffice will begin the evaluation process.

## Submitting App Store information (for standard applications)  

If you are publishing a **standard application**, you must also submit App Store information.  

### **What to include in your submission:**  

* **Application name and description**  
* **Screenshots and marketing materials**  
* **Pricing and licensing details**  
* **Support contact information**  

### **How to submit App Store information:**  

1. **Go to your application page in the developer portal**  
2. **Select "App Store information" from the left menu**  
3. **Click the "Request to publish" button**  

ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** [Updating App Store information](request-to-publish.md)

## Tracking the approval process  

Once you submit a publication request, SuperOffice will create a **support ticket** and follow up via email.  

### **Checking the status of your request:**  

1. **Go to the SuperOffice developer portal**  
2. **Open the "Messaging center"**  
3. **Look for the status of your request:**  
   * **Pending** â€“ Waiting for review  
   * **Approved** â€“ Ready for Stage or Production  
   * **Rejected** â€“ Requires changes before approval  

If your request is **rejected**, you will receive feedback on necessary corrections.
