## 1. Welcome and overview

**Objective:**

Introduce you to the role of a software vendor on the SuperOffice Developer Portal and outline the goals of this series.

**Step-by-step:**

* **Understanding the purpose:**

  Learn that as a partner, you’re not just building an integration or application—you’re extending the capabilities of SuperOffice CRM Online. Your work enables custom integrations and complementary applications that enhance the value of our CRM.

* **Overview of the series:**

  This series is divided into nine tutorials, each addressing a specific stage of the journey—from registration, through app creation and configuration, to production deployment and ongoing maintenance.

## 2. Understanding SuperOffice environments

**Objective:**

Gain insight into the different environments used for development, testing, and production.

**Step-by-step:**

* **What are the environments?**

  * **SuperOffice Online Development (SOD):**

    This is your sandbox environment for research, experimentation, and early development. It’s a safe space to test your app without impacting live data.

  * **Stage:**

    A pre-production environment where your application is evaluated for performance and security under conditions that mimic production.

  * **Production:**

    The live environment where your application will serve real customers.

* **Why they matter:**

  Each environment serves a distinct purpose. SOD is for building and testing, Stage ensures stability under load and compliance with security standards, and Production is where your fully vetted application goes live.
