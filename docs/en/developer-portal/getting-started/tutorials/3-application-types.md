## Standard vs. custom applications

SuperOffice applications fall into two main categories:

### **Standard applications**

* These apps are **built for multiple customers**.
* They are **published in the SuperOffice App Store**.
* Customers can **install them directly** from the App Store.
* They must go through a **certification process** before deployment.

**Examples of standard apps:**

* ERP sync and quote integration
* Email marketing add-ons
* Document management systems

üìå **Reference:** [Building standard apps](apps-get-started.md)

### **Custom (one-off) applications**

* These apps are designed for **a single customer**.
* They are **not available in the App Store**.
* They must be manually installed for the **specific customer‚Äôs tenant**.
* They require **approval** before deployment.

**Examples of custom apps:**

* Internal business automation tools
* Company-specific data synchronization services

## Available application templates

When registering a new application in the **SuperOffice developer portal**, you will choose from one of the following templates:

| **Application type** | **Use case** | **Best for** |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Web app** | Interactive browser-based applications | Web-based integrations (OAuth 2.0) |
| **Native app** | Installed software with a local client | Desktop or mobile apps (PKCE flow) |
| **Server-to-server app** | Background services that don‚Äôt require user interaction | Automated processes, API integrations |
| **Mirroring app** | Database replication for offline access | Syncing SuperOffice data to an external database |
| **ERP sync & quote app** | Connecting SuperOffice to an ERP system | Integrating with ERP and quote services |
| **Empty app (DIY)** | A blank template for advanced users | Fully custom integrations |

Each template comes with **pre-configured API settings**, but you can **modify** them after creation.

## Choosing the right template

To determine the best template for your application, answer the following questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Will your app require users to interact with it in a web browser?**

* If **yes**, choose a **web app** or **native app**.
* If **no**, consider a **server-to-server app** for automation.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Will your app need access to SuperOffice without a logged-in user?**

* If **yes**, use **server-to-server app** (system-user authentication). Good for **web applications** that also need **back-channel** communications.

* If **no**, use **web app** (interactive login).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Is your app syncing SuperOffice data to another system?**

* If **yes**, consider **ERP sync & quote** or **mirroring app**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Are you building a unique solution that doesn‚Äôt fit a template?**

* If **yes**, start with the **empty app (DIY)** template and configure it manually.
