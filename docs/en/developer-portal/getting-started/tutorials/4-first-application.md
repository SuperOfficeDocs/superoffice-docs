* Open your browser and navigate to [SuperOffice Developer Portal](https://dev.superoffice.com/)
* Log in with your **developer credentials**

2. **Navigate to your partner page**

* After logging in, go to the **partner page**

* Select one of the available templates:
  * **Web app** â€“ for browser-based applications
  * **Native app** â€“ for installed desktop or mobile applications
  * **Server-to-server app** â€“ for background automation without user interaction

## Entering application details

Now, you need to **define the basic settings** for your application.

### **Step-by-step instructions:**

1. **Enter a unique application name**

    * Choose a clear and descriptive name
    * Example: *SuperOffice Sales Dashboard*

2. **Add redirect URLs (if required)**

    * Some applications, like **web apps and native apps**, require **redirect URLs**
    * Redirect URLs handle authentication and authorization flows

        Example format:

        ```url
        https://devnet-tools.superoffice.com/openid/callback
        ```

3. **Set the technical contact**

    * The technical contact is the **developer responsible** for maintaining the application
    * Enter their **name and email address**

4. **Confirm application settings**

    * Review all entered details
    * Click **create application**

## Understanding client IDs and application credentials

Once your application is created, it is assigned a **unique client ID**. This client ID is **essential** for authentication and API communication.

### **Where to find your client ID**

* After creating the application, go to the **application overview page**
* Locate the **client ID** under the **configuration section**
* The client ID is required for **OAuth authentication and API calls**

ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** [Finding your client ID](index.md)

## Verifying your application details

To ensure your application is correctly registered, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the applications section in the developer portal**
2. **Select your newly created application**
3. **Check the following:**
    * Is the **application name correct**?
    * Are the **redirect URLs properly set**?
    * Is the **technical contact information accurate**?

If anything needs updating, you can modify the configuration in the developer portal.
