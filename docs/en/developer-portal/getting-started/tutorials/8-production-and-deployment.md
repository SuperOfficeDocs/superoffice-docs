# Step 8: Production deployment and ongoing maintenance  

Welcome to **tutorial 8** of the **SuperOffice developer onboarding series**! Now that your application has been approved for publication, itâ€™s time to **move it into production** and set up a plan for **ongoing maintenance**.  

This tutorial will cover:  

* **Understanding the transition from SOD to production**  
* **Deploying your application to the production environment**  
* **Monitoring performance and handling errors**  
* **Updating your application after deployment**  
* **Ensuring long-term maintenance and support**  

By the end of this tutorial, your application will be **live in production**, and youâ€™ll have a strategy for keeping it running smoothly.

## Understanding the transition from SOD to production  

SuperOffice applications go through **three main environments** before reaching production:  

* **SOD (SuperOffice Online Development)** â€“ Used for development and testing  
* **Stage (Pre-production environment)** â€“ Used for final testing before production  
* **Production** â€“ Live environment where customers use your application  

Before deploying, verify that:  

* **Your application passed all testing in SOD and Stage**  
* **All necessary approvals have been granted**  
* **Your application meets SuperOfficeâ€™s security and performance guidelines**

## Deploying your application to the production environment  

Once your application is approved, SuperOffice will move it from **Stage to Production**. You must ensure your application is fully prepared for deployment.  

### **Steps for a smooth production deployment**  

1. **Verify final configurations**  
   * Ensure **client IDs, secrets, and API endpoints** are set correctly for production  
   * Update **redirect URLs** to point to your live servers  

2. **Prepare your hosting environment**  
   * Use **reliable cloud hosting** (Azure, AWS, or another provider)  
   * Ensure **scalability and availability** for high traffic  

3. **Enable logging and error tracking**  
   * Set up **logging mechanisms** to capture errors and API failures  
   * Monitor system health using **logging tools like Azure Monitor or AWS CloudWatch**  

4. **Conduct a final round of testing**  
   * Perform a **smoke test** to ensure all features work as expected  
   * Verify authentication, API calls, and user workflows

## Monitoring performance and handling errors  

Once your application is live, itâ€™s crucial to **monitor its performance** and **quickly address any issues**.  

### **Best practices for monitoring**  

* **Set up automated alerts** for API failures, downtime, and unusual activity  
* **Track application logs** to identify potential issues before they affect users  
* **Monitor system resources** such as memory, CPU, and network usage  

### **Handling errors and failures**  

1. **Use structured error logging**  
   * Capture **error messages and stack traces**  
   * Categorize issues by **severity (critical, high, medium, low)**  

2. **Implement automatic retries**  
   * Handle **temporary API failures** with **retry logic**  
   * Use **exponential backoff** for repeated requests  

3. **Provide clear error messages to users**  
   * Display user-friendly messages instead of generic errors

## Updating your application after deployment  

SuperOffice allows you to update your application **without disrupting customers**.  

### **Steps for a safe update**  

1. **Create a new version in the developer portal**  
   * Log in and navigate to your application  
   * Click **"Create new version"** in the configuration section  

2. **Apply and test changes in SOD**  
   * Make updates in the **SOD environment** before publishing  
   * Conduct **regression testing** to ensure nothing breaks  

3. **Request to publish the new version**  
   * Once tested, **submit a request** for approval  
   * SuperOffice will review and approve the update for production

## Ensuring long-term maintenance and support  

To keep your application running smoothly, you must **plan for ongoing maintenance and support**.  

### **Best practices for long-term maintenance**  

* **Stay updated with SuperOffice API changes**  
  * Subscribe to **SuperOffice developer updates**  
  * Regularly review the **SuperOffice API documentation**  

* **Monitor customer feedback**  
  * Use the **SuperOffice messaging center** for customer reports  
  * Address **bug reports and feature requests promptly**  

* **Plan for periodic security reviews**  
  * Regularly update **authentication and encryption settings**  
  * Perform **security audits** to check for vulnerabilities
