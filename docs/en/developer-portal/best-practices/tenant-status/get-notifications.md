# Register to get notifications when tenant status changes

When a tenant installation changes, SuperOffice sends a [change notification][2] to each approved application. The **State change URL** is set in the advanced application configuration of each application.

## To receive notifications (onetime set-up)

1. Set up a web service listening for state changes. For example:

    `https://www.awesomeapp.com/NotifyCustomerStateChange`

2. In the Developer Portal, go to your app page.

3. Select **Configuration**.

4. Turn on **Advanced**.

5. Select **Notifications**.

    ![Configure notifications -screenshot][img1]

6. Enter the URL of your endpoint SuperOffice should push notifications to when a tenant changes status.

    `https://www.awesomeapp.com/NotifyCustomerStateChange`

    Optionally, turn on **Configure per Environment** to set different URLs for SOD, Stage, and Production.

    ![Configure notifications per environment -screenshot][img2]

7. [!include[Has integration?](../../includes/has-integration.md)]

8. Click **Save Settings** or **OK**.

9. [Request to publish the new configuration.][3]

You are now set to parse notifications when you get them.

## Parse notifications

The application **must** take advantage of these notifications to ensure their environments are kept up-to-date with the status of SuperOffice CRM Online tenants.

While there are several ways to process tenant status changes notification, the following is a short example of what that might look like using .NET and C#.

### CustomerStateChangeNotificationType Enumeration

### NotificationMessage

[!code-csharp[CS](includes/NotificationMessage.cs)]

### API Controller and JWT Validation
