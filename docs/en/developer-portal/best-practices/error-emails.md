# Error reporting emails

SuperOffice will also send you emails when there is a problem with your application. By default, these emails go to the technical contact of the application. However, you can also specify a list of addresses for error reporting.

Watch the walk-through on YouTube:

## ERP sync, quote, and mirroring

For each endpoint you have configured SuperOffice to send data to, you can also subscribe to error emails.

To turn off/on error emails to the technical contact for an endpoint, update the integration settings configuration of the application.

* [ERP sync][5]
* [Quote connector][6]
* [Database mirror][4]

To receive error emails at different or more than one email addresses, update the application settings:

1. On the app page, select **Settings** from the left menu or click the **Edit** button.

2. Scroll to the bottom and enter one or more addresses in the **Error reporting emails** field.

    The addresses must be separated with a semicolon ( ; ), no spaces.

3. Click **Save Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can update the email addresses in the application settings at any time. Technical contact will receive any notification mail if this field is blank.

## Other errors

For other errors, such as when a customer reports a problem from the App Store, the technical contact will be notified if error reporting emails field is empty.
