Metered API calls come from applications that are not part of the SuperOffice standard products.

**Count** is the number of API calls. **Record count** is how many database records these API calls asked for. One database record could be asking for a company (with all additional entities, such as address, phones, URLs, and emails), and it may be one contact person with all additional entities linked to it. Asking for a list will count each list item as one database record.
