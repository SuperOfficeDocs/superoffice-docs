# Add a user

[!include[Definition of user](../includes/def-dp-user.md)]

You can view the users already added on your partner page.

## Who can I add?

You can assign a known user or create a new one. In both cases, you look up an email address.

* If it matches an existing [SuperID][2] user account **in production**, all you have to do is to assign it to the partner. If you know this user is a SuperOffice CRM Online user, make sure you use the correct UPN - firstname@company.com vs firstname.lastname@company.com
* If the address is unknown, you can fill in a form to create a new user. This person becomes both a SuperID user and a portal user.

## How to

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.
2. Select **Users** from the left menu.
3. Click **Create User**.
4. Enter a valid email address and click **Find user by email**.

5. Either assign a known user or create a new one.

    For known SuperID users, click **Assign to Partner**.

    If the user is unknown:

    1. Click **Create User**.
