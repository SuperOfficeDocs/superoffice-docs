# Manage permissions

Depending on their [role][1], users need different permissions. For basic access, a person needs login and read access. To make changes, they need access to one or more of the following areas:

* [Manage contents of App Store pages][2] (App Store)
* [Configure apps][3] (Configuration)
* [User management][4] (Users)

This task requires **User management** permission.

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.
2. Select **Users** from the left menu.
3. Locate the user in the list and click **Edit item**.
4. To grant a permission, tic the corresponding checkbox. To remove a permission, uncheck it.
