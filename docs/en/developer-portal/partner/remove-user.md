# Remove a user

This task requires **User management** permission.

Administrators can disconnect a SuperID user from a partner in the SuperOffice Developer Portal. This action does not delete the SuperID user account, nor does it impact the userâ€™s access to tenants. The user retains the ability to sign in to their tenants and, if associated with multiple partners, can still access the Developer Portal and carry out tasks based on the permissions granted by those partners.

## Steps

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.
2. Select **Users** from the left menu.
3. Find the user in the list and click **Remove**.
4. Click **YES** to confirm.
5. If the user is a contact person, their responsibilities must be reassigned prior to removal. Follow the provided instructions to make necessary updates.
    * **Technical contact for applications:** Select a new technical contact for ALL the listed applications.
