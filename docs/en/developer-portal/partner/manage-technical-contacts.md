# Manage technical contacts

Each partner and application has a designated technical contact who receives email alerts for issues.

## Identify which apps a user is technical contact of

1. In the Developer Portal, go to your partner page.
2. Select **Technical contacts** from the left menu.
3. Browse the user list to see the number of applications each contact oversees.
4. Click the chevron to view or hide the specific applications linked to each contact.

## Reassign technical contact for apps

1. Find the user on the **Technical contacts** page and select **Edit**.
2. Choose the applications to reassign. By default, all applications are selected for reassignment. Uncheck the box next to an application to retain the current technical contact.
3. Pick the new technical contact for the selected applications.
4. Click **Save**.

### For more control over reassignment

* Click the application name in the overview to go to its page. Click **Edit** to change the technical contact for that specific application. This method is slower but may be necessary if the technical contact requires a specific skill set.

* Or, follow the steps above, but select a smaller subset in step 2. After saving, repeat the steps with another subset. This allows you to quickly distribute responsibility among several users. Useful if the partner has numerous applications.
