## Steps to create a new dashboard

1. In the navigator, click the **Dashboard** icon (<i class="ph ph-gauge" aria-label="gauge icon"></i>) to open the Dashboard screen.

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **Create a new dashboard**.

1. In the dialog, enter a **name** for the dashboard.

1. Optionally enter a **description**. This text appears at the top of the dashboard.

    Click <i class="ph ph-translate" aria-label="Translate"></i> to add the name and description [in other languages][5].

1. Select a theme from the **Theme** list to control the visual style.

1. Choose how many columns the dashboard should have from the **Columns** field.

1. Click **Save**.

    The dashboard opens with no tiles. The **Edit dashboard tiles** sidebar is displayed so you can [add tiles][2] right away.

> [!NOTE]
> The person who creates the dashboard is automatically set as the **owner**. Ownership cannot be changed later.

## <a id="pin"></a>Share or pin a dashboard

If you have the **Dashboard administrator** (or general administrator) functional right, you will also see these fields when creating or editing a dashboard:

* **Visible for:** Share the dashboard with specific users or groups.
* **Pin to:** Always display this dashboard for selected users or groups.

These options are only available if you have the required functional rights.

## <a id="copy"></a>Duplicate a dashboard

You can duplicate an existing dashboard to reuse its layout or content. For example, to create your own version of a pinned dashboard.

1. Select the dashboard you want to duplicate.

1. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and choose **Duplicate dashboard**.

    The new dashboard opens with "2" added to the name.

    * To rename or update the dashboard, select **Edit dashboard** from the Task menu.
    * To modify its tiles, select **Edit dashboard tiles**.

## Tips

* Use clear names when creating multiple dashboards to stay organized.
* Organize dashboards by purpose or team.
* Want to reuse just one tile? You can [copy a tile to another dashboard][1] instead of duplicating the whole dashboard.
