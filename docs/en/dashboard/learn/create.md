1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.

2. Click the **Task** button and select **Create a new dashboard**.

3. In the dialog, enter the name of the dashboard. This becomes the name of the dashboard tab.

4. Enter a description of the dashboard. The description is displayed at the top of the dashboard.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also add the name and description [in other languages][1] by clicking ![icon][img1].

5. Select the theme of the dashboard in the **Theme** list.

6. Select the number of columns to use for the dashboard, in the **Columns** field.

7. In the **Visible for** field, specify who should see this tile. By default, the dashboard is visible only to you. If you have additional functional rights, you can make the dashboard visible/accessible for one or more user groups, or individual users.

8. Use the **Pin to** function to always show this dashboard for selected users. You can use this function for all users or for selected user groups or users. Using this function requires functional rights.

9. Click **Save**.

    The new dashboard opens, containing no tiles.

On the right side of the new dashboard, the **Add tile / Edit layout** section is displayed. You can now start [adding tiles to the dashboard][2].

There is a lot of standard tiles to choose from in the library, but you can also create your own, either based on an existing tile or start with clean sheets.
