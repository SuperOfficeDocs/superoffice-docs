# Dashboard

The **Dashboard** feature in SuperOffice CRM gives you quick access to the charts, reports and statistics that are most important to you. You can choose from a wide range of pre-defined tiles, and also add tiles from dynamic selections or create your own.

Dashboards are displayed as tabs at the top of the screen. Pinned dashboards and dashboards set as favorite are displayed here, in addition to the most recently used dashboard. To view other dashboards that you have access to, search in the navigator.

  * **Big numbers:** Lets you emphasize an important aggregate metric or KPI (key performance indicator).
  * **Web panel:**  Display an url/web page inside a tile.
  * **HTML code:** Display HTML code inside a tile.

* **Dataset:** Selection of data showing in the tile, like a dynamic selection with search criteria.

* **Layout:** Change the settings to adjust how the data is displayed in a tile.

* **Dashboard tab:** Each tab contains a dashboard displaying different tiles with different data that can provide insight and serve as a decision-making guide.

## Tiles

In SuperOffice Dashboard you have many of [pre-defined standard tiles][6] to choose from, and charts that are linked to dynamic selections. The tiles fall into eight different categories: Company, Contact, Follow-up, Sale, Project, Document, Product, and Request.

Each tile in a dashboard contains either a chart, a list, or a number. A dashboard can contain multiple tiles.

The tiles can also be customized to show only data from selections. Access rights and confidentiality apply to the tile data, so tiles will display only information you have access to. Tile data typically relates to you, or your groups, and to a specific period (such as this month, last 6 month)

## Customize your dashboard

You can pick from many pre-defined tiles to visualize and evaluate your work, with a snapshot of activity levels, customer segments, product statistics, project details, and sales. By customizing your dashboard tiles, you get to show the graphs and overviews that are most valuable for you personally.

### Create your own graph for the dashboard

If you cannot find the right tile for you, you can create your own tiles based on your selections. You can visualize all dynamic selections in graphs to give you the information you need in a quick and easy-to-understand way. You can also create your own tiles from start with wanted criteria and the layout that show your data correctly.

### Create additional tabs

By default, only one dashboard tab, called Status, is set up. It contains different tiles with pre-defined charts. You can edit this tab and/or add extra dashboard tabs, where you can present all the tiles and charts of your choice.

### Edit or create your own tiles

If you do not find the tile you need among the set of pre-defined tiles in SuperOffice Dashboard, you can always [create your own tile][4].
