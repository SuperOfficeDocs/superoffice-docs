# Customize your dashboard

You can tailor each dashboard to focus on the information most relevant to you. Choose from pre-defined tiles, or create your own to visualize activities, customer segments, product trends, project updates, or sales results.

## Edit dashboard settings

You can update the name, description, layout, or visibility of an existing dashboard.

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.

1. Select the dashboard you want to edit.

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **Edit dashboard details**.

1. Make your changes:
    * Change the **name** or **description**
    * Select a different **theme**
    * Adjust the number of **columns**
    * If you have the required functional rights, update **Visible for** and **Pin to** settings

1. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the number of columns, the tiles are automatically rearranged to fit the new layout. No tiles are removed, but the grid may reflow in a way that creates empty spaces. You can move or resize tiles afterward to improve the visual layout.

## <a id="owner"></a>Transfer ownership

As the owner or an administrator, you can transfer ownership of a dashboard to another user.

1. Click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **Edit dashboard details**.

1. In **Owner**, select the new owner.

1. Open the dashboard.
1. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and choose **Edit dashboard tiles**.
1. [Follow these steps to manage tiles][2].

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete a dashboard

Only the **owner** of a dashboard, a general administrator, or a dashboard administrator can delete a dashboard.

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.
1. Select the dashboard you want to remove.
1. Click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and select **Delete this dashboard**.
1. Click **OK** to confirm.

> [!NOTE]
> If the dashboard was pinned to others, it will be removed from their Dashboard screen as well.
