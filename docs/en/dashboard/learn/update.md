# Edit a dashboard

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.

2. Select the dashboard you want to edit.

3. To change the name of the dashboard and adjust other settings, click the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>), and select **Edit dashboard**.

4. To add tiles and edit the dashboard layout, click <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task button"></i> and select **Add tile / Edit layout**.

5. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you reduce the number of tiles, all extra tiles are deleted from the dashboard (beginning with the last tile). The tiles are ordered left to right, top to bottom. If you increase the number of tiles, existing tiles are rearranged, and new empty tiles will be added.
