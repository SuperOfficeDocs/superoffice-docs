# Working with tiles

## Edit or create your own tiles

If you do not find the tile you need among the set of pre-defined tiles in SuperOffice Dashboard, you can always [create your own tile][4].

## Export tiles

Click <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Task menu"></i> in the header of a tile to access the following options:

* **Download PDF document** / **Download PNG document**: Download the tile in PDF or PNG format. The export files are downloaded to your browser (**Downloads** folder).

* **Print**: Open the tile in the print dialog.

> [!TIP]
> To hide specific data before exporting or printing a tile, click the data labels (legend) next to or under the tile to hide data.
