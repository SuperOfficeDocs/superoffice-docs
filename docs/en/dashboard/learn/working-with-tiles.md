# Working with tiles

A dashboard can consist of any number of tiles. Each tile contains a graphical or numerical representation of SuperOffice data.

## View tiles and data

* Click on data in a tile (for instance a sector in a pie chart) to display the underlying data.

* Place the mouse-pointer over a section of a tile to view source data in a pop-up box.

* Click the data labels (legend) under the tile to hide/show specific data in the tiles. This can be useful for printing or exporting the tiles.

* Click ![icon][img1] in the header of a tile and select **View in full screen** to open the tile in full screen. Useful for tiles with much content.

### Examine underlying data

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.

2. Select the relevant dashboard.

3. Click on data in a tile (for instance a column in a column chart). A new window displays the records in the section you clicked.

4. Here you have the following options:

    * Click a record to see a preview on the right-hand side of the window.

    * Double-click a record to open it (or select a record and click **Open**).

    * To [copy the records to a selection][4], click the **Task** button and select **Copy into selection**. If you do not select any records, all records are copied.

5. Click **Close** when you are done.

## Export tiles

Click ![icon][img1] in the header of a tile to access the following options:

* **Download PDF document** / **Download PNG document**: Download the tile in PDF or PNG format. The export files are downloaded to your browser (**Downloads** folder).

* **Print**: Open the tile in the print dialog.

> [!TIP]
> To hide specific data before exporting or printing a tile, click the data labels (legend) next to or under the tile to hide data.
