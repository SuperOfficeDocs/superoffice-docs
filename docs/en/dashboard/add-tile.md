# Add tile / edit layout in dashboard

To add a tile to a dashboard:

1. Open the **Dashboard** screen.

2. Select the dashboard you want to edit.

3. Click the **Task** button, and select **Add tile / Edit layout**. On the right side of the selected dashboard, the **Add tile / Edit layout** section is displayed.

4. In the **Show tiles for** list, select the type of records you want to use, for instance companies, follow-ups or sales. Relevant tiles are displayed in the **Library** and **Selections** tabs below:

    * **Library**: This tab contains a set of pre-defined tiles from the online template library. The icon next to the tile name indicates the tile type.

        > [!TIP]
        > You can also select an empty tile to create a tile from scratch.

    * **Selections**: This tab contains dynamic selections with [charts][2], and will only show selections of the same record/entity type selected in the **View** list above (for example, company or sale).

    > [!NOTE]
    > When using a selection chart, the dataset is copied, and any changes to the selection will not be reflected in the tile.

5. Optional: Use the search field to find specific tiles.

6. To add a tile to the dashboard, drag and drop it on the desired position on the dashboard. You can also click **Add** to add a tile to next available position. The tile will automatically adjust to the available space, and will align with the grid and columns setup.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 to add more tiles.

8. Adjust the tiles on the dashboard:

    * Hold the mouse-pointer over a tile and click and drag the frame to adjust the tile size. Available slots/spaces in the dashboard are highlighted in yellow when the tile can fit in that position.

    * Click the header of a tile and drag it to another position.

9. Click **Done**.
