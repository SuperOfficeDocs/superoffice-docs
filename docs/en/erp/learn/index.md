# ERP

If your organization uses an ERP system that is connected to SuperOffice CRM, you can synchronize data between the two systems. This integration helps maintain consistent company, contact, and project information across platforms, reducing manual updates and errors.

## The ERP tab

The **ERP** tab appears on the **Company**, **Contact**, and **Project** screens if your organization has a license for [Development Tools][1].

Use the **ERP** tab to:

* Link a SuperOffice company to a customer or supplier in the ERP system.
* Link contacts to matching individuals in the ERP system.
* Link SuperOffice projects to ERP projects.

Once linked, data is synchronized automatically or on demand.

> [!NOTE]
> The **ERP** tab is only available to users with the required license and the appropriate settings enabled in Settings and maintenance.
