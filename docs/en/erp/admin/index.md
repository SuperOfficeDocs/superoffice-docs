# Manage ERP synchronization

The **Sync** tab in the Quote/Sync screen in Settings and maintenance lists Sync Connectors and ERP connections that enable integration between SuperOffice CRM and external ERP systems.

[!include[Requirement](../../learn/includes/req-expander-services.md)]

## Terminology

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| **Sync connector** | The *integration* component that connects SuperOffice CRM to an external ERP system. Each connector points to a specific ERP system. |
| **ERP connection** | A *configuration* that uses a sync connector to define what to sync, how to authenticate, and which ERP client to target. You can have multiple connections per connector. |
| **ERP actor** | A record in the ERP system that can be linked to a SuperOffice CRM entity. |
| **CRM entity** | A record in SuperOffice CRM—typically a company, contact, or project—that can be linked to an ERP actor. |

You can use the **Sync** tab to add, configure, and prioritize connections.

## What ERP sync enables

When ERP integration is configured correctly, users can access the **ERP** tab on the **Company**, **Contact**, and **Project** screens in SuperOffice CRM.

From this tab, users can:

* Link SuperOffice records to matching actors in the ERP system.
* Trigger manual synchronization (for example, by clicking **Sync now**).
* View synchronized fields and values from ERP.

This helps reduce duplicate data entry and improves data consistency across systems.

> [!NOTE]
> The **ERP** tab only appears for users who have the correct license and access to an active ERP connection.
