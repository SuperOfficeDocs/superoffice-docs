# Edit ERP connection

You can update the name, scope, or configuration values for an existing ERP connection.

> [!NOTE]
> If the connection is active (checkmark in the **Active** column), you must temporarily deactivate it before updating configuration fields. Remember to reactivate the connection after configuration.

## Steps

1. In Settings and maintenance, select <i class="ph ph-barcode" aria-label="Barcode icon"></i> **Quote/Sync** in the navigator and go to the **Sync** tab.

1. Select the ERP connection and click **Configure ERP connection**.

1. In the dialog, update the name or scope as needed.

1. To update connector-specific configuration fields:

    1. Clear the **Active** checkbox.
    1. Update fields as needed.
    1. Select **Active**.
    1. Click **Test ERP connection** and fix any errors.

1. Click **OK** to save and close the dialog.

1. If you need to change field mappings, default values, or list mappings, do so now using the buttons in lower-left corner. For detailed instructions, see [Configure ERP connection][1].

## Troubleshooting

### ERP connection cannot be saved

If the **OK** button is dimmed when adding or editing a connection:

* Make sure the connection test has succeeded.
* Check that all required configuration fields are filled in.
* Confirm that any mandatory settings (such as scope) are completed.
