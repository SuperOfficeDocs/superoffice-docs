# Add a sync connector and ERP connection

[!include[Requirement](../../includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

To synchronize data between SuperOffice CRM and an ERP system, you must first install a sync app. Then, in Settings and maintenance, you must add a sync connector and configure one or more ERP connections.

## 1. Install the sync app

Before you can add a sync connector, you need a sync app for your ERP system.

1. Check the [SuperOffice App Store][7] for a standard sync app that supports your ERP system.

    If no standard app is available, or if you require a customized version, you can have one [developed by a SuperOffice partner][8] or your in-house team.

1. Follow the app provider's instructions to install and register the connector.

1. In Settings and maintenance, select <i class="ph ph-barcode" aria-label="Barcode icon"></i> **Quote/Sync** in the navigator.

1. Open the **Sync** tab.

1. Click **Add** below the **Sync Connectors** list.

1. Enter a name and the connector URL.

1. Click **OK**.

The sync connector is added to the list.

    The **Define new ERP connection** dialog opens.

1. Enter a name for the ERP connection.

1. Select the sync connector to use from the list.

1. Define the **scope**:

    * **Everyone:** All users can access and use this ERP connection.
    * **Specific users and groups:** Only selected users and groups can access it. Click the link to open the scope dialog and select access.

1. Fill in the **configuration fields**. These are specific to the selected connector and may include authentication, file paths, numeric settings, or other technical values.

1. Optionally, enter a description to clarify the purpose of this connection.

1. Click **Test ERP connection**.

    If the test fails, check the connector URL and the configuration fields. You must fix the issue before continuing.

1. Click **OK** to save the connection. The new ERP connection appears in the list.

    If the **OK** button appears dimmed, it means either the test has not succeeded or some mandatory fields are missing.

> [!NOTE]
> Before the ERP connection can be used, you must configure synchronization settings and activate it. See [Configure ERP connection][1].
