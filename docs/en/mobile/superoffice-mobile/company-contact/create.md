# Create contact

When you are out visiting, you can register contacts directly from Mobile CRM.

Note: If the company that the contact belongs to has not yet been entered, you need to do that first. See Add companies.

## Steps

1. Go to the main **Company/contact** page.
2. Tap **+** and select **New contact**.
3. Enter first and last.
4. Select the company they belong to.
5. Add other details as necessary. For example, phone number and email address.
6. Save the contact.

## Add on company

1. Locate and open the company.
2. Tap **+** and select **Add new contact**.
3. Enter first and last name.
4. Optionally add other information and save.

## Add profile picture / logo

1. Tap the image in the header.
1. Select **Add image from camera** or **Add image from gallery**.
1. Take or choose an image.
1. Tap and drag to select a region, or select OK to use the entire image.
1. Save.

## Best practices

* To avoid duplicating entries, search for the contact in question first to check that they have not already been entered.
* Enter all phone numbers with country codes, so that you can call directly no matter where you are in the world.
