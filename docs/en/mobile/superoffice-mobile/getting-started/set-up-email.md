# Setting up an email account

To to send and receive emails within Mobile CRM, you need to connect an email account to SuperOffice CRM. If you have used SuperOffice for a while, you might have done this already.

## Is my account already connected?

1. In Mobile CRM, tap the **Task** icon (![icon][img5]) and select **Settings**.
2. Select **Email settings**.
3. If you see the message "Email account must be created in the web client", you are not yet connected.
