# Getting started

![Mobile CRM - layout -screenshot][img1]

## Navigator

Use the Navigator menu to access the main screens in Mobile CRM: Diary, Company/contact, Sale, Project, Requests, Dashboard, or Notifications.

Once you choose a main screen, the menu will slide to the left and disappear.

### Screen optimization

On devices with small screens, the navigator is hidden automatically. Select the home icon in the upper left corner to display the navigator.

## Notifications

If the icon for Notifications shows a number in a red circle, it means you have pending invitations. You also get notifications about overdue sales.

## Task menu

The **Task** menu is located at the bottom left on many screens. This menu contains options that are relevant for the current screen. For example, logging in or out, settings, filtering, sending SMS/email, or map display.

### Refresh

When you use the app, the pages you access are stored in the device's cache to make navigation faster. Information is automatically updated when you open the app. To manually refresh data, do one of the following:

* To update a page, tap the **Task** icon, and select **Refresh**.
* To clear the cache, tap the **Task** icon, go to **Settings**, and select **Refresh all data**.

## Favorites

The star tab shows your favorite records within the current screen. This way your favorite records are always easy to find.

## Tabs

The main screens and associated sub-screens consist of tabs. Look for the highlighted icon to
see which tab is selected.

## Search

To view the diary of other users, tap your name and choose a user from a list. This also apply in the sales section.

In all main pages, you can search for information stored in your SuperOffice. Go to the main page for Contacts, and select the Search tab to search for Companies/Contacts. To search for Projects, go to the main page for Projects and select Search. In appointments and sales; select your name, and then search by name.

## Create new

The **New** icon creates a new entry in the database. What type of entry that is created depends on which screen you are in. For example, in the Diary screen, you can create a new appointment. In the Sale screen, a new sale, and so on.

## Swipe

Throughout the app, you can swipe for easier and faster navigation. Access the menu to edit contacts, add to favorite, send SMS, or send an email.

The green button allows you to create a new email or call the contact directly.
