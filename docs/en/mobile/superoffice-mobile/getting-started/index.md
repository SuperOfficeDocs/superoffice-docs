* To clear the cache, tap the **Task** icon, go to **Settings**, and select **Refresh all data**.

## Favorites <i class="ph ph-star" aria-hidden="Star icon"></i>

  * Tap the star in corner of the header when viewing the item.

In all main pages, you can search for information stored in your SuperOffice. Go to **Company/Contact**, and select the **Search** tab to search for a company or contact. To search for projects, go to the **Project** main page and select **Search**. In appointments and sales, select your name, and then search by name.

## Swipe

Throughout the app, you can swipe for easier and faster navigation. Access the menu to edit contacts, add to favorite, send SMS, or send an email.

The green button allows you to create a new email or call the contact directly.

## Create new (+)

The **+** icon creates a new entry in the database. What type of entry that is created depends on which screen you are in. For example, in the Diary screen, you can create a new appointment. In the Sale screen, a new sale, and so on.

## View mode and edit mode

View mode is for getting info and taking action. For documents and email, switch between previewing content and viewing its properties.

Edit mode is for adding or updating info. For documents and email, edit applies to properties, not content.

## Dark mode

If you have set your phone to use dark mode, your Mobile CRM app will also use dark mode.
