## No current email account?

If you see the message "No current email account" when trying to send an email, it means your Mobile CRM app doesn't yet have access to an email account.

Mobile CRM supports two ways to send email. Choose the option that best fits your situation:

### Option 1: System default

Uses your device's existing mail app. This is the fastest way to send emails and requires no setup in SuperOffice.

* Best for quick replies or when you're on the go.
* Works as long as you have any email app configured on your phone.
* Emails are not archived in SuperOffice or linked to CRM records.

When selected, you'll be asked to choose your preferred email app the next time you send an email.

### Option 2: SuperOffice

Uses SuperOffice's built-in email client. This option integrates email into your CRM workflow.

* Emails are automatically archived and linked to contacts, sales, or projects
* Supports attachments, follow-up creation, and full CRM visibility
* Requires setup in the SuperOffice web client

To connect your email account, follow these steps: [Set up your email account in SuperOffice][1]

**Tip:**

* Use *System default* if you just need to send a quick message.
* Use *SuperOffice* if you want to share and archive communication with your team.
