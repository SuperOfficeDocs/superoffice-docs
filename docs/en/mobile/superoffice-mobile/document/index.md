# Documents ![icon][img12]

You have access to all documents and emails stored in the database from Mobile CRM.

## Where can I find documents?

Documents are linked to a specific contact, company, sale, or project. In SuperOffice CRM, you therefor find each document in the **Activities** section tab of the entity it belongs to, rather than all documents in a central location.

Mobile CRM treats documents in the same way. In the app, the Company, Contact, Sale, and Project screens all have a **Documents** tab.

In lists, you will typically see date, type, and title for each document. The sort order is *sent - descending*.

> [!TIP]
> You can perform some actions on your documents and emails without opening them. Swipe left on the document or email to see the options.
