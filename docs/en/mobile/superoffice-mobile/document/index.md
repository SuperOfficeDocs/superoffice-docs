# Documents <i class="ph ph-files" aria-hidden="true"></i>

From Mobile CRM, you have access to all documents and emails stored in the SuperOffice database.

## Where to find documents

Documents are linked to a specific company, contact, sale, or project. In SuperOffice CRM, you find each document in the **Activities** section tab of the relevant entity, not in a central location.

Mobile CRM uses the same logic. In the app, the **Documents** section is available in the company, contact, sale, and project screens.

In document lists, you typically see the date, type, and title. The sort order is *sent - descending*.

> [!TIP]
> You can perform actions without opening the document. Swipe left on a document or email, then tap <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> to access the task menu.
