# Approve sale

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires SuperOffice 10.1.5 or newer and Mobile CRM 10.2.2 or newer.

When working with sales and quotes, you sometimes add a higher discount rate that is wanted, and you need someone else to approve the sale. With notifications for quote approval in Mobile CRM, the sale can progress without any friction.
