# Approve sale

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires SuperOffice 10.1.5 or newer and Mobile CRM 10.2.2 or newer.

When working with sales and quotes, you may sometimes apply a higher discount rate that requires approval. Mobile CRM allows you to handle quote approvals seamlessly, whether you're a sales rep or a manager.

## Sales rep

You cannot send a quote if it has warnings, errors, or needs approval. The **Send** button (in SuperOffice CRM) appears dimmed until all issues are resolved.

If approval is required, the quote gets the status **Needs approval**.

1. In Mobile CRM, check your push notification settings and make sure **Quote approval response** is on. You will be notified as soon as the quote is approved (or rejected).

## Manager: Approve or deny a quote

Managers can review and respond to approval requests directly from Mobile CRM.

1. Ensure your **push notification settings** are enabled for **Quote approval request**.
1. When you receive a notification, tap it to open the **sale** in Mobile CRM.
1. Review the quote details.
1. Tap **Approve** or **Reject**.
