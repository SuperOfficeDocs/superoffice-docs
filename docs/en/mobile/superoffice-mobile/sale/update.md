## Change status of a sale

1. Open the sale.
2. Tap the status icon below the sale header.
3. Select one of the options:

    * Move to next stage
    * Set as sold
    * Set as lost
    * Mark as stalled

    You can also swipe left on the sale in a list, tap the **Task** icon, and select a status.

4. Go to the **Details** tab, tap **Edit**, and update any other fields with new information. For example:

    * Update the **Reason (sold)** field with the reason for the sale.
    * Update the **Reason (lost)** field with the reason why the sale was lost.
    * Update the **Reason (stalled)** field with the reason why the sale was stalled. Also set the **Re-open date**.

## Link to an incoming request

When you are in a sales process, consider linking the sale to relevant incoming requests to have it show up in the **Requests** tab on that sale.

1. Go to the main **Request** page.
1. Search for the request by name or ID.
1. Tap **Edit** on the selected request.
1. Scroll down, then tap **Sale** and select the sale you want to link.
1. Save. The next time someone views that sale, the item you linked is included on the **Requests** tab.
