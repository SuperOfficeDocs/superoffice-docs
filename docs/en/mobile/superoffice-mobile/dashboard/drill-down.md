# Drill down

Working with dashboard sometimes gives you some numbers you are more curious about. You can drill down from dashboard tiles to explore the dataset behind the visualization in Mobile CRM like you do in the web client.

A drill-down screen is a list showing items of one type of entity. Selecting an item will open the screen for this item.

## Which tile types can I drill down into?

* Chart (visualization)
* Big numbers (aggregate metric or KPI)
* Lists (showing a defined selection)

## Steps

1. Go to the main **Dashboard** page.
1. Select a pinned or favorite dashboard or search for one by its name.
1. Select a tile.
1. View data:

    * Chart: tap once to select a part of the chart. Then tap again to view the details behind the section.
    * Lists: tap the list item.
    * Big numbers: tap the number.
