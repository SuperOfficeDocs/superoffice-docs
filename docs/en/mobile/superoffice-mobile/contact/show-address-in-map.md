# Show address in map

Mobile CRM uses the default map service on your device to display addresses. You can open a map either from the **Map** button in the action bar or by tapping an address field directly.

> [!TIP]
> The **Map URL** can be configured under **System settings**, and the behavior may vary depending on your device and platform.

## Steps

1. Open a company or contact.

1. Do one of the following:
    * Tap the **Map** button in the action bar. If multiple addresses are available, select which one to display.
    * Tap any address field in the **Details** section.
