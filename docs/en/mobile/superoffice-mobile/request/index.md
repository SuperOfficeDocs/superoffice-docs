# Requests <i class="ph ph-ticket" aria-hidden="true"></i>

From the **Requests** screen, you can follow up on customer tickets and collaborate with your team while on the go.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Requests** screen is available only if your company has a Service or Complete license.
> Some users may be able to view requests without a service user plan, depending on their role and the request category. These users cannot reply or take action on the request.

## Tabs in the main Requests screen

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| Search | Search field for ID or title, with history list. |
| Favorites | Requests marked with a yellow star. |
| Open requests | Your assigned requests, or another user's. |
| Unassigned requests | Open requests without an owner. |
| Selections | Requests from predefined selections. |

## Where to find requests

You can access requests from the following locations:

* The main **Requests** screen. Lists typically show:
  * Request icon and status badge
  * Title
  * Customer name
  * Created date and time
  * Request ID

* The **Requests** section in a company, contact, sale, or project screen, which shows open requests linked to that record.
