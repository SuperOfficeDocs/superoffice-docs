# Respond to requests on your mobile device

Response time is often a key metric for teams handling incoming requests.

> [!NOTE]
> A [Service user plan][6] is required to take action on a request.

## Accept

For a request to be your responsibility, your name must appear in the **Owner** field.

If the request is unassigned, self-assign it to prevent others from responding at the same time.

## <a id="reply"></a>Reply / reply all <i class="ph ph-arrow-bend-up-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>

A reply is an external message sent to the customer.

1. Tap **Reply** on the action bar.

1. The customer's email address is prefilled in the **To** field. Optionally, add more recipients.

1. Update request properties as needed (owner, status, category).

1. [Compose your message.](#message)

    > [!NOTE]
    > Your signature is automatically included if available. See [how to add a signature](#add-signature).

1. Tap **Send**.

## <a id="comment"></a>Add comment (internal)

Comments are internal messages used to collaborate before responding to the customer.

They are shown with a red background, are not visible to the customer, and are excluded when forwarding a request.

1. Tap **Comment** on the action bar.
1. Update request properties as needed.
1. Write your comment.
1. Tap **Save**.

## <a id="forward"></a>Forward <i class="ph ph-arrow-bend-up-right" aria-label="Forward"></i>

Use **Forward** when you need to share the request with someone outside the organization.

[Forwarding a request][1] compiles all external messages along with your own message into a single email.

1. Tap <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu icon"></i> and select **Forward**.
1. Add one or more recipients in the **To** field.
1. Update request properties as needed.

## <a id="call"></a>Call customer <i class="ph ph-phone" aria-hidden="true"></i>

Use the **Call** button to contact the customer directly from the request screen.

1. Tap **Call** in the action bar.

1. Select the number to dial.

1. Use the toggle to decide whether to log the call in SuperOffice.

    * When enabled, the call is logged as a phone activity under the request.

While composing a reply or comment, you can add images, insert a reply template, or include a link to a FAQ from the **Task** menu.

> [!TIP]
> To discard your draft, tap the **Task** icon and select **Remove text**.

When your message is finished (you might insert multiple items):

    * Maximum total size: 25 MB per message.

A [reply template][3] can help you respond faster with predefined content.
