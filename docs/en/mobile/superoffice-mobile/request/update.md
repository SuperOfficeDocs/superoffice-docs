# Update request

A Service user plan is required to update a request. For details, see the [list of user plans][4].

## Edit request fields

1. Open the request.
2. Tap the **Edit** icon (<i class="ph ph-pencil-simple" aria-label="Edit icon"></i>).
3. Update the fields as needed.
4. Tap **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> From a list, swipe left on a request, tap <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="swipe menu icon"></i>, and select **Edit**.

### What you can update

Your permissions depend on your role, the request category, and whether you are the owner.

Most commonly updated fields:

* Status
* Priority
* Owner

Only the owner can update the fields *Read status* and *Last changed*.

> [!NOTE]
> The fields *Created at* and *Deadline* are not editable and do not appear in edit mode.

## Change status

You can update the status in one of the following ways:

* When viewing a request, tap <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu icon"></i> and select **Set next request status**.

* From a list, swipe left, tap <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="swipe menu"></i>, and choose **Set next request status**.

* Open the request in edit mode, change the status field, and tap **Save**.

## Assign, accept, or delegate a request

To make a request your responsibility, your name must be in the **Owner** field.

To update the owner:

* When viewing the request, tap <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu icon"></i> and select **Set owner**.

* From a list, swipe left, tap <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Swipe menu icon"></i>, and select Set owner.
