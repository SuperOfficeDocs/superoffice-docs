# Update request

You need a Service or complete license to update a request. For details, see the [list of user plans][4].

## What can I update

Your options depend on your role, the request category, and whether you are the owner of the request. Most commonly, you will update the status, priority, and owner, when responding to a request.

Only the owner may update the fields *Read status* and *Last changed*.

> [!NOTE]
> The fields *Created at* and *Deadline* are not shown in edit mode because they cannot be update manually.

## Steps

1. Locate and open the request.
2. Select **Details** (![icon][img1]).
3. Tap the **Edit** icon (![icon][img2]) in the footer.
4. Update the information as necessary.

5. Tap **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking at a list of requests, for example your open requests or requests linked to a specific sale, you can swipe left and select **Edit**. This is a shortcut for steps 1-3 above.

## Change status of a request

Do one of the following:

* When viewing the request, tap the **Task** icon and select **Set next request status**.
* In a list, swipe left and choose **Set next request status** from the Task menu.
* Open the request in **Edit** mode, change the field, and save.

## Assign, accept, delegate

[!include[Owner](../../../request/learn/includes/request-owner.md)]

Whether you want to accept an unassigned request, take over for a colleague, or delegate to a request handler, the steps are the same. Do one of the following:

* When viewing the request, tap the **Task** icon in the footer and select **Set owner**.
* In a list, swipe left, and choose **Set owner** from the Task menu.
