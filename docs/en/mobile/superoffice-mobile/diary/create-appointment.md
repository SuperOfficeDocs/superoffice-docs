# Create follow-up

When you are out visiting, you can create follow-ups directly from Mobile CRM. Follow-ups are activities with a defined start and end time, such as meetings.

## Steps

1. Go to the Diary.
1. Tap **+** and select **New appointment**.
1. Specify the **start** and **end date** and **time** for the follow-up.
1. Select a **follow-up type** and enter a **title**.
1. In the **With** section, choose the **company** or **contact** the follow-up is with.
1. Optionally, select any sale and/or project that the follow-up concerns.
1. Add other details if needed:
    * Set **Busy** or **Free** in the **Show as** field to indicate your availability.
    * Enter **Location** or **Video link** if required.
1. Save the follow-up. Now you can **add more attendees** if necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see the conflict icon (<i class="ph ph-warning-circle" aria-label="Exclamation mark"></i>), it means that you already have a follow-up at the time in question.

## Create new follow-up based on an existing one

You can save time by duplicating an existing follow-up and editing its details.

1. Locate and open the follow-up you want to use as basis.
1. Tap the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and select **New based on existing**.
1. Update the information as needed.
1. Tap **Save** to create the new follow-up.

## Create follow-up another person

You can create follow-ups directly in another person's calendar, as long as you have access.

1. In the **Diary**, tap the **name** just below the row of tabs.
1. Select the person whose calendar you want to use.
    * Their name will display in **red** to indicate the switch.
1. Tap **+** and follow the steps in **Create a follow-up**.

## Add attendee and resources

After creating a follow-up, you can invite attendees or book resources (such as a meeting room and projector).

> [!NOTE]
> You must be the owner of the follow-up to add attendees and resources.

1. Locate the follow-up.
1. Tap <i class="ph ph-pencil-simple" aria-label="Edit icon"></i> to edit.
1. In the **With** section, tap **Add attendees**.
1. Search for and select contacts.

    * To add someone not registered in SuperOffice, tap <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i>, select **Add email address**, and  enter their email address.
1. Tap the arrow (<i class="ph ph-arrow-left" aria-label="Back"></i>) to close the **Attendees** section.
1. Optionally, tap the **Location** section and select the item you want to book.
1. Tap **Save** to finalize.
