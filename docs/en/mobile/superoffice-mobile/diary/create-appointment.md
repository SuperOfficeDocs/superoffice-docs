# Create appointment

When you are out visiting, you can create appointments directly from Mobile CRM. Appointments are activities with a defined start and end time, such as meetings.

## Steps

1. Go to the Diary.
2. Tap **+** and select **New appointment**.
3. Tap the header to specify the start and end date and time for the appointment.
4. Select an appointment type and enter a description.
5. Tap the **With** section and choose a company or contact that the appointment concerns.
6. Optionally, select any sale and/or project that the appointment concerns.
7. Add other details as necessary. For example, set **Busy** or **Free** in the **Show as** field to indicate your availability during the appointment.
8. Save the appointment. Now you can, for example, add more attendees to the appointment.

> [!NOTE]
> If you see the conflict icon, it means that you already have an appointment at the time in question. Tap the time in the header to see all the appointments you have on that day.

## Create new appointment based on an existing one

You can save time by basing a new appointment on an existing one and amend the information as required.

1. Locate and open the appointment you want to use as basis.
2. Tap the **Task** icon and select **New based on existing**.
3. Update the information.
4. Tap **Save** to create the new appointment.

## Create appointment for another person

The person who owns the calendar will be defined as the owner of the appointment. To create an appointment in someone other's calendar, simply switch who's calendar you're viewing.

1. Select their name just below the row of tabs in the Diary screen.
2. Tap **+** at the bottom right corner and follow the steps outlined above.

## Add attendee and resources

Once you have created an appointment, you can invite attendees to it. You can also add resources to the appointment (such as a meeting room and projector).

> [!NOTE]
> You must be the owner of the appointment to add attendees and resources.

1. Locate and open the appointment.
2. Tap **Add people**.
3. Search select attendees.
4. To add a resource, tap the chair icon and select the item you want to book.

    > [!TIP]
    > To get a list of all resources, tap **Search** leaving the search box empty.
