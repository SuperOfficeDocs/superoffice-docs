# Update appointment

## What information can you change

* Appointments you are invited to: If you have accepted an invitation, you can edit only the alarm settings and whether you want to show yourself as busy or free.

* Appointments you have created: Here you have full edit rights.

* Other people's appointments: You can edit appointments on behalf of other people. This is called secretary mode. In that case, you open the appointment in another person's calendar.

## Steps

1. Locate and open the appointment.
2. Tap the **Edit** icon (![icon][img3]) in the footer.
3. Update the information as necessary.
4. Tap **Save**.

If this a repeating follow-up, only the current instance of it is updated, not future instances of the same appointment.

## Mark an appointment as completed

1. Locate and open the appointment.
2. Tap the toggle icon next to **Completed** in the **Details** section.

> [!TIP]
> If you mark an appointment as completed by mistake, tap the toggle again to revert the status.

## Move appointment

An alternative to editing the start and end time of an appointment, you can drag and drop it to a new location in your schedule.

1. Click on the wanted appointment. It shows the appointment over the whole diary.

2. Push down and then drag it to the new time you want the appointment.

3. Release your finger when you are happy and the appointment is moved.

You can of course also drag and drop inside the diary to create new follow-ups.

## Remove participants/resources

1. Locate and open the appointment.
2. Tap the number in the **With** section showing invited participants and resources.
3. In the list of selected participants, swipe left on the item you want to remove.
4. Tap the **Task** icon and select **Remove participant**.

## Set alarm

To activate or update an alarm for the appointment:

1. Tap the **Edit** icon in the footer.
2. Expand the **Details** section and tap the **Alarm** option.
3. Choose **No alarm**, **When meeting starts**, or a specific lead time you want to be notified ahead of the appointment.
4. Save.

## Cancel/delete an appointment

1. Locate and open the appointment.
2. Tap the **Task** icon and select **Delete appointment**.
3. Select **Yes** to confirm.

* If you own the appointment, all the invited participants are notified of the cancellation.
* If you are invited to the appointment, the appointment owner can see that you have rejected the invitation.
