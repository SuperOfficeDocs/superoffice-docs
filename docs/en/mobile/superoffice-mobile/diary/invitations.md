# Accept and decline invitations

New invitations appear in two places:

* The **Invitations** tab on the **Notifications** screen. Tap the bell (<i class="ph ph-bell" aria-hidden="true"></i>) to open notifications.
* The **Diary** screen under **Upcoming**, **Day**, **Week**, and **Month** tabs.

| Status icon | Description |
|:-:|---|
| <i class="ph ph-question" aria-label="Question mark"></i> | **Not opened:** A question mark is shown next to new invitations. |
| <i class="ph ph-eye" aria-label="Eye"></i> | **Seen but not responded to:** An eye icon appears if you have viewed it but not replied. |

> [!TIP]
> Not sure if you are available? Tap the time in the invitation header to look at your schedule for that day.

## Respond to invitations

You can **accept** or **decline** a follow-up directly from either the **Notifications** screen or the **Diary** screen.

## Handle cancellations

If you are the **owner** of the follow-up, you are notified if someone **declines**.

For **recurring follow-ups**: You can quickly confirm the cancellation by **swiping left** and tapping <i class="ph ph-check" aria-label="Checkmark"></i>.
