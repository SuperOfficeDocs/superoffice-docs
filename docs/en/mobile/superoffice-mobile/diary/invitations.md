# Accept and decline invitations

![Mobile CRM: Invitation -app-screen][img2]

New invitations show up in the **Invitations** tab on the **Notifications** screen and the tabs on the **Diary** screen.

* If you have not opened the invitation yet, there is a question mark next to it.
* If you have seen the invitation but not yet responded, there is an eye next to it.

> [!TIP]
> Not sure if you are available? Tap the time in the invitation header to look at your schedule for that day.

## Accept/decline from Notifications

* Swipe left on the invitation and tap the checkmark or red x.
* Or, tap to open the appointment and select **Accept** or **Decline**.

## Accept/decline from Diary

* In the Day, Week, and Month tabs, tap open the appointment and select **Accept** or **Decline**.
* In the Upcoming tab, swipe left on the invitation and tap the checkmark or red x.

## Give a reason for declining

When you decline an invitation, search for a predefined reason or write a reason for declining manually.

## Can I change my mind?

Accepted appointments can be declined later from the **Task** menu.

## When someone cancels

As the owner of the appointment, you will be notified if someone declines.

You can confirm canceled recurring meetings quickly by swiping left and tapping the checkmark.
