# Join video meeting

With the **Video meeting** option in SuperOffice CRM, you can easily join a meeting on the go, directly from your mobile device.

## Join from Diary

1. Open the follow-up.
1. Tap the **Join video meeting** button at the top OR the link in the **Video link** section.
1. Mobile CRM automatically selects the **most suitable option** based on your device:
    * If a video app is installed, it opens automatically.
    * If not, the meeting opens in your **browser**.

## Join from notification

If you have configured **notifications** for meetings, a **pop-up alert** will appear when the meeting is about to start.

* Simply tap **Join video meeting** in the notification to join instantly.
