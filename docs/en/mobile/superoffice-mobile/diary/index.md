### See who has been invited to an appointment

The number shows how many attendees (including the person who created the appointment) have been invited.

Persons without an icon have not yet viewed the invitation.

## View your own calendar

When planning new appointments, you will usually want to check your own calendar first.

1. Go to the Diary.
2. Check that your name appears at the top.

    If another person's name is shown in red, this means that you are looking at another person's calendar. Select the person's name and switch to your own calendar.

3. Select the Day, Week, or Month tab and choose a date.

4. Select an appointment to examine it.

## View other calendars

It can be useful to check whether the persons you want to invite are free on the day in question.

1. In the Diary, select the name just below the row of tabs.
1. On the **View other calendar** page, select a person from the history list or search for a calendar owner. When you have selected the calendar of another person, their name is shown in red above the appointment list.
1. Explore their calendar as described above.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open another person's calendar, only information that you have the rights to see is shown.
