# Manage notifications

Control which push notifications you receive from Mobile CRM, such as meeting invites, alarms, or request updates.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings affect **push notifications** on your device. Filters selected from the **Task** menu only affect the items you see inside the app.

## Open notification settings

1. Tap <i class="ph ph-list" aria-label="Main menu"></i> in the bottom center of the screen.
1. Select **Settings**
1. Tap **Notifications**.

You'll see a screen like this, with options for calendar events, requests, and reminders:

## Calendar notifications

You can choose to receive push notifications for:

* Meeting invitations
* Meeting changes
* Invitation rejections
* Appointments with alarm (only those where you've set a reminder)
* All appointments, regardless of alarm status

You can also customize:

* Reminder time (for example, 10 minutes before the event)
* Exceptions – exclude specific types of appointments (such as Private)

### Add exceptions for appointment types

To exclude certain appointment types from notifications:

1. Tap **Add exception**.
1. Select the type you want to exclude (for example, **Private** or **Other**).
1. Repeat these steps for each additional type you want to exclude.
1. Tap **Save**.

Each toggle can be adjusted individually.
