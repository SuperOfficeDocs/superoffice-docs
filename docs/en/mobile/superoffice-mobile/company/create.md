# Add company

When you are out visiting, you can register companies directly from Mobile CRM.

## Steps to register a new company

1. Go to **Companies**.

1. Tap **+** and select **New Company**.

1. Enter the name of the business.

1. Add other details as necessary. For example, phone number, and email address.

    To add a logo, tap the placeholder icon. Then tap **+**, select **Add image from camera** or **Add image from gallery** from the menu, and follow the instructions.

1. Tap **Save**.

## Update company information

Updating company information is similar to [editing a contact][3]. Simply, tap the **Edit** icon (<i class="ph ph-pencil-simple" aria-label="true"></i>) in the upper-right corner.
