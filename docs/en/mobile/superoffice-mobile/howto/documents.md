    This will take you to the document dialog where you can open the document or send it as an email. If the document type is email, you can forward, reply all, or reply to  the recipients of the email.

* Emails are automatically opened for preview on both iOS and Android devices.
* On iOS devices, documents are automatically opened for preview.
* On Android devices, you will see "Unable to show the content of this document." Click on the download button (1) and select which app (2) on your device to open documents in.

## Create documents

You have limited functionality for creating documents. At the bottom of the document tab  there is a button New document.

When you tap on it, the application allows you to upload an image of the document (not the document file). You can either make an instant picture by tapping on **Add image from camera** or uploading an image that you took before by tapping on **Add image from gallery**.
