# Show address in map

1. Go to the Company/contact page.
2. Open a Company or Contact (either in the history list or search for any).
3. Tap on the **Location** icon in the menu bar, or tap on the field **Street Address**.
4. If the field contains an address, Mobile CRM will open the default map service on the your device and show the address.
