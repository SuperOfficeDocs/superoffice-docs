# Upgrade to SuperOffice 8

You may update CRM Pocket clients automatically if you currently run Pocket Server 7.3.1 (or higher).

From SuperOffice 8.0 Pocket CRM clients have a NetServer connection only and the Pocket server is obsolete.

To automatically move users from using Pocket Server to NetServer, you have to manually change a text file in the Pocket CRM Server installation.

1. Open the *Server.PROPERTIES* file in the Pocket server configuration. The default location for this file is:

    `C:\Program Files (x86)\SuperOffice Pocket CRM\Tomcat 6.0\webapps\pocketcrm\WEB-INF\classes\server.properties`

2. In the file, locate the server's hostname and the path to the */services80* folder. Added the following to the **netserverUrl** property. Adjust for your endpoint version.

    `CLIENT_CONFIGURE=soprotocol://?netserverUrl=https://socrm.myoganization.com/netserver/services80`

3. Restart Tomcat. Normally this can be done by restarting **PocketCRM** in Local services.

Now when you navigate to the Pocket configuration screen on your browser, you will see something like this:

Pocket users will then be redirected immediately when they restart the Pocket application.

It may be wise to let the Pocket server run for a while to be sure that all users have been "moved".

For the Pocket user it is possible to verify the redirection by checking **Task - Settings - About Pocket CRM**.

> [!NOTE]
> Server URLs must end with the correct *ServicesXX* folder.
