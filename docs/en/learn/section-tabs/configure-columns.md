## Change the order of the columns

To change the order of the columns in a section tab, click and drag a column header to a new location.

## Add or remove column

1. Go to the section tab you want to edit.
2. Click ![icon][img1] to the right of the column headers. A dialog is displayed.
3. Select or deselect the relevant columns. Use the **Filter columns** fields to filter the columns that are displayed.
4. Click **OK**.

To reset the columns to the default view, click **Reset**.

## Manually adjust column widths

1. Hold the mouse pointer over the vertical dividing line to the left or right of a column heading. The mouse pointer changes into a double vertical line with arrows.

1. Click down with the mouse button and drag the divider in the required direction to increase or decrease the column width. The column widths you set are retained between sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot adjust column widths manually if **Auto-fit column width** is active.

## Automatically adjust column widths

You can set columns widths to be adjusted automatically according to the content of the columns. When columns are added or removed, all column widths are adjusted to a best fit every time. If there are too many columns to fit within the available space, a horizontal scrollbar is displayed.

1. Go to the section tab you want to edit.
2. Click ![icon][img1] to the right of the column headers. A dialog is displayed.
3. Select **Auto-fit column width**.
4. Click **OK**.
