# Activities tab

There are various types of [activities][1] in SuperOffice CRM, including follow-ups, mailings, form submissions, and chat records.

The **Activities** section tab in SuperOffice CRM provides a comprehensive overview of follow-ups, documents, and emails linked to a specific entity (company, contact, project, or sale). It allows users to track and manage interactions efficiently, ensuring all relevant activities are easily accessible.
