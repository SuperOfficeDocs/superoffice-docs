# Sales tab

The **Sales** section tab in SuperOffice CRM allows users to view and manage [sales information][1] related to specific entities, such as companies, contacts, projects, and diaries. It displays a list of all sales connected to an entity, making it easy to track activities in context and gain deeper insight into sales performance and pending actions.

The **Sales** section tab contains the following columns to display key information about each sale:

| Column | Description |

## View sales in the Sales section tab

1. Go to the relevant screen, such as Company, Contact, Project, or Diary.

1. Click on the **Sales** tab to see all sales linked to the entity.

1. Double-click a sale in the list to open the Sale screen and view detailed information.

### Filter sales

You can filter the list of sales by date, user, or group by clicking the **Filter** button (![icon][img2]). This helps focus on specific sales activities that need attention.

### Include stakeholders

To include sales where the current company or contact is involved as a [stakeholder][3], check the **Include stakeholders** box at the bottom of the section tab. This provides a broader view of all sales activities related to the entity.

## Sales task assistant

The **Sales** section tab acts as a **Sales task assistant** to help you maintain an overview of ongoing sales activities. It functions as a sales-oriented task list, providing a summary of:

* **Uncompleted sales:** All ongoing sales where the sale date falls within the defined display range.

* **Planned sales activities:** All sales with scheduled activities for a specific number of days ahead.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The number of days ahead is user-defined. To change this preference, go to **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Functions** > **Show days ahead**.

* **Overdue activities:** All sales that have overdue activities (end dates earlier than today). These sales are highlighted in red for easy identification.

* **Stalled sales:** If a sale is marked as [stalled][4] and has a Reopen date, that date will overwrite the one in the Next activity field and will be displayed in the Next activity column.

This view helps users stay on top of pending actions, making sure that nothing slips through the cracks, ultimately improving sales management.

## Add sale

To add a new sale directly from the **Sales section** tab:

1. Select **Add** to open the sale creation dialog.

1. Enter sale details: Complete the required fields and click **Save**.

## Additional tips

* **Quick navigation:** Use the [Navigator][7] to quickly switch between different entities and their corresponding **Sales** tabs.
