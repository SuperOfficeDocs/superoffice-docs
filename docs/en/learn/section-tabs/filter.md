# Filter the section tabs

The section tabs in SuperOffice CRM can contain large amounts of data, such as contacts, activities, and sales.

A great way to find information quickly is by using filters. Filters reduce the amount of information you are looking at, making it faster to find what you are looking for.

You can filter the content of section tabs by adding criteria to one or more columns.

Filters are personal. The filters you use, are visible only for you and you can add and remove filters at any time.

Multiple filters can be active at the same time. If a section tab does not display the expected records, check your filter settings.

## Filter activities and sales

2. Select the **Activities** or **Sales** section tab.

3. Click the ![icon][img2] filter icon.

4. In the **From** box, specify from how far back in time you want to show activities or sales.

5. In the **To** box, specify for how far ahead in time you want to show activities or sales.

    Click the arrow to the right of the **To** box to open a list of possible time intervals. For example, to show all activities or sales defined for the next quarter.

6. Choose one of the following options:

    * To show the activities or sales for a specific group, select the required group in the **Groups** list. The members in the group will then be selected for you on the **Associates** list on the right.

    * To show activities or sales for one or more associates, select the required contacts in the **Associates** list. To select several, hold down the CTRL key as you select the people you want.

    * To show your own activities or sales, select **Mine**.

    * To show all activities or sales for all groups and associates, select **All**.

7. Click **OK**. The tabs will show all activities or sales that match the criteria you specified.
