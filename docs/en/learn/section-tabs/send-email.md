# Reply to or forward email from the Activities section tab

Email messages that are saved as documents for a specific company are displayed on the **Activities** section tab for that company.

To forward or reply to an email of this kind is very similar.

## Steps

1. [!include[Go to company](../includes/goto-company.md)]

1. Select the **Activities** section tab.

1. Select the required email message.

1. Right-click and choose an action:

    * **Reply:** A message addressed to the person who sent you the original message is opened in your default email program. Enter the required information.

    * **Forward:**. The original message is displayed in your email program. Add recipients and any supplementary information.

1. When you finish the message, and want to send it, you have the following options:

    * To send the message straightaway, click the **Send** button.

    * To send the message and [archive it as a document][1] in SuperOffice CRM, click **Send and archive**. The **Document** dialog opens.
