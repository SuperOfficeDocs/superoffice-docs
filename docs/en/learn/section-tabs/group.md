# Grouping lists

A great way to order information to find, review, and access information efficiently is by grouping the information. Grouping information means you sort information as a set of people or things, that have something in common.

You can group the information in an archive by all the fields/columns in the archive. For example, group a list of activities on category, so you can view all your follow-ups or web forms; group a list of requests on category and status, so you can get an overview of request statuses per category.

Grouping is personal. The columns you use to group your information, are visible only for you and you can add and remove as many groups as you like.

Learn how to customize views by configuring columns with this short video, or read the instructions below (video length - 1:43):

## Enable grouping

1. Click the ![icon][img1] settings icon to the right of the column header and select **Enable grouping**.

    ![Enable grouping -screenshot][img5]

1. Click **OK**.

Now, a new row is displayed above the column headers.

## To group a list

1. Find the archive that you want to group the information on.

1. Click and drag a column header to the row above the column headers.

    For example, if you are looking for a document connected to one of the contacts working for this company, you can drag and drop the Contact column into the bar. Then do the same for the Activity type column.

    The list now displays a row per value in the selected column. If you selected a category column, each available category in the column is displayed on a separate row. Click the row to expand the group and show the records.

1. To group on a second value, repeat the procedure above. You can add as many columns as you want to use.

## Remove selected grouping

1. To remove a grouping column you have selected, click the X behind the column. The list of records in the archive is updated immediately.
