> [!NOTE]
> Before we launched SuperOffice CRM version 9, our app was called SuperOffice Pocket CRM. This app is still operational (not supported with NetServer 10.0 or higher) and used by users on SuperOffice CRM version 8.5 or lower.

When you upgrade from versions 8.5 or lower to version 9, you will be prompted inside Pocket CRM to update the app and switch to Mobile CRM.
