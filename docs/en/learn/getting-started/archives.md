Every archive in SuperOffice contains a Settings button on the right-hand side. When you click the Settings button a new dialog will appear. This dialog allows you to enable filters for this archive.

Every archive in SuperOffice contains a Settings button on the right-hand side. When you click it, a new dialog will appear. This dialog allows you to enable for this archive.

The columns you use to group your information, are only visible for you and you can add and remove as many groups as you like.
