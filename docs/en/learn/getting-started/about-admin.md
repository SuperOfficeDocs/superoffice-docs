# Settings and maintenance

Settings and maintenance is the administration client for SuperOffice CRM.

The navigator buttons in Settings and maintenance activate their associated functions with a single click, making it easy to navigate quickly between the different parts of the system.

The **App Store** navigator button opens the SuperOffice App Store, where you can explore standard apps, modules and integrations that can expand your SuperOffice CRM.

Certain features like import and scripting are only available from the [Windows-based administration client][1].
