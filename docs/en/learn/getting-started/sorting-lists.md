# Sort lists

There are different lists in SuperOffice CRM, for example, lists of contacts and activities. You can decide which columns are displayed in these lists, how wide they should be and how they should be sorted.

In the different section tabs in SuperOffice CRM, you can sort the lists by the various columns in ascending or descending order.

## Simple sorting

Click once on a column heading to sort the list by this column in ascending order. Click once more to sort in descending order.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Groupe lists][1]
* [Use filters in the section tabs][2]
* [Change the rank of contacts][5]
* [Adjust column widths][3]
* [Configure columns][4]
