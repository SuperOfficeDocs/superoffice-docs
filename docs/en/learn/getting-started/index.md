## About SuperOffice CRM

SuperOffice CRM is a web-based system to manage and follow up on all contacts, sales, and projects. The core of the system is the Company card. All information and communication concerning a company and contacts are stored here: contact details, emails, a phone call conversation or a planned meeting. This ensures that everybody within the organization can have access to the customer information they need. Instead of having their own contacts on their personal computers.

The Company card consists of different sub tabs (section tabs) that provides good overview and control of all your contacts, relations, activities and meetings, sales, projects and requests.

If you deal with customers that are not (yet) associated with a company, the Contact card provides similar features to the Company card.

The system also has other features. For example, you can use Dashboards and Selections to get an overview of contacts (based on categories, business or other criteria), sales, projects and activities. This is very helpful when you need to keep colleagues up to date on a weekly basis.

The Diary helps you with your scheduling, and you can stay in touch with your customers using the Chat feature. Sale and Project provide additional tools for effectively managing your business.

With Marketing, you can send a mailing to a specific group of contacts to inform them about upcoming events, company news, campaigns and other product information. Here you can also create forms to be used on your website or customer centre for easier feedback, content management and sign-up.

With Requests, you handle all communication concerning a specific request is stored in a single location, regardless of it is by email, web form, phone or another channel. In this way, the organization ensures that all requests are followed up, and that no enquiries sit unanswered in the users' own inboxes.

Requests can be categorized, prioritized and routed. Most importantly, all communication with a customer can be tracked, so that users can always maintain an overview of each customer relationship.

For example, there is an internal knowledge base consisting of reply templates and FAQs. This data can be used for look-up, or users can make them available to customers. It is also possible to link SuperOffice Service to an external customer portal where the customer can follow-up their requests. Using a customer portal, customers can also have access to FAQs, so that they can find answers to their queries without having to contact a request handler.

### The same starting point for many tasks
