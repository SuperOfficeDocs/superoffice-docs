# Getting started

SuperOffice CRM is easy to get started with. It is extremely user-friendly with many new functions to make your working day more productive.

Both new users and previous users of SuperOffice will benefit from reading this user guide. It gives an overview of the facilities and functions in SuperOffice CRM and explains how the program will benefit you and your company.

## Using in-app help

This help is designed to give you comprehensive and readily accessible information about how to use SuperOffice CRM. Wherever you are in the program, no matter what you are doing, you can always get help about the precise task you are involved in.
