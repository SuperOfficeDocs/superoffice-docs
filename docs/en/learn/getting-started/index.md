## Overview

SuperOffice CRM centralizes all customer interactions, whether through sales, marketing, or support, ensuring you stay organized and efficient. Core features include managing contacts, tracking activities, sending marketing campaigns, and resolving customer requests.

The system is highly user-friendly and designed to make your workday more productive, with tools like:

* **Company and Contact cards:** Manage all customer information in one place.
* **Section tabs:** View activities, sales, projects, and requests related to each contact.
* **Diary and scheduling:** Organize your tasks and collaborate with colleagues.
* **Dashboards and selections:** Gain insights and share updates easily.

## Explore the main sections

SuperOffice CRM is divided into several key areas:

* **Diary:** Schedule and track your day-to-day activities.
* **Sales:** Manage your sales pipeline and follow up with prospects.
* **Service:** Handle customer requests efficiently in one system.
* **Marketing:** Create and track email campaigns or SMS communications.
* **Projects:** Organize project-related communication.

Learn how to access these areas using the [Navigator][1] or global buttons.

## SuperOffice: onsite vs. online

SuperOffice CRM is available as a cloud-based online application or as an onsite installation. While the core functionality is the same, some features, like import and scripting, are only available in the onsite Windows administration client. To access SOLoader, advanced import, replication, Travel and scripting, see [Windows Client settings][20].
