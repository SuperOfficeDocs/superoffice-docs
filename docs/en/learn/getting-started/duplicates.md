# Duplicates

> [!NOTE]
> You can deactivate the duplicate check in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance (**Preferences** > **Functions**).

When you create new companies, projects, and selections, a duplicate check is automatically performed. The duplicate check looks for identical and similar names in the SuperOffice database to avoid creating records that already exist in SuperOffice CRM (such as companies), in addition to preventing the creation of records with very similar names.

If you try to enter a company name, project name or selection name that is identical or similar to an existing record in SuperOffice CRM, the **Duplicates** dialog appears. The dialog lists one or more companies, projects or selections that have names identical and/or similar to the one you entered.

You can continue working with the current record or go to one of the records listed at the bottom of the dialog.

To change the settings for the duplicate check, click the **Settings** button in the **Duplicates** dialog.

You can also access these settings from the Main menu ( ![icon][img1] ).
