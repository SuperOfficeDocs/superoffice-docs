# Google Workspace as your solution

## Intro

With Google Workspace as your solution, there are several ways to connect your email account, documents, and calendar to SuperOffice.

## <a id="step-2"></a>Email

[!include[Why](includes/why-connect-email.md)]

Choose one of the following options:

* [SuperOffice Inbox][1] (default). [Watch this video to get started][10].

* [Gmail Link integration][2] - if you already use Gmail and want to access key information and features from SuperOffice directly in your email and archive emails in SuperOffice.

    1. Go to the app entry for Gmail Link in the [SuperOffice App Store][11].
    1. Click **Install**, choose browser (Chrome or Firefox), and follow the instructions.
    1. Sign in to SuperOffice. The extension is detected automatically.

## <a id="step-3"></a>Document

The **Google Workspace document integration** enables you to open, edit, and store documents in Google Workspace directly from SuperOffice CRM.

Use Google Workspace apps to edit SuperOffice CRM documents from any computer and store documents written via SuperOffice CRM directly and seamlessly in your Google Workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> This option requires an active Google Workspace subscription and is available only if your administrator has [set up the integration][3]. Alternatively, use SuperOffice document library with WebTools (or Microsoft SharePoint).

## <a id="step-4"></a>Calendar

Choose one of the following options:

* [!include[SuperOffice Inbox](includes/so-inbox-for-invitations.md)]

* [!include[Synchronizer](includes/why-synchronizer.md)]
