    The **Google Workspace document integration** enables you to open, edit, and store documents in Google Workspace directly from SuperOffice CRM.

    Use Google Workspace apps to edit SuperOffice CRM documents from any computer and store documents written via SuperOffice CRM directly and seamlessly in your Google Workspace.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This option requires an active Google Workspace subscription and is available only if your administrator has [set up the integration](../../../../en/document/cloud/g-suite/index.md). Alternatively, use SuperOffice document library with WebTools (or Microsoft SharePoint).
