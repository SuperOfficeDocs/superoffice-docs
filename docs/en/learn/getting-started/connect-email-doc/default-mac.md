    [!include[ALT](includes/set-up-inbox.md)]

    [!include[Go to App Store](../../../email/superoffice-for-outlook/learn/includes/install.md)]

## Document ![icon][img2]

The default document integration on macOS is **SuperOffice document library** with [WebTools for Mac][3].

## Diary and invitations ![icon][img3]

Choose one of the following options:

* [SuperOffice Inbox][2] (default)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you chose SuperOffice Inbox in step 1, you are already done.
