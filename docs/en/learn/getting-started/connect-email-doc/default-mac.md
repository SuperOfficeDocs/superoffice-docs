## <a id="step-2"></a>Email

[!include[Why](includes/why-connect-email.md)]

* [!include[SuperOffice for Outlook](includes/why-superoffice-for-outlook.md)]

## <a id="step-3"></a>Document

The default document integration on macOS is **SuperOffice document library** with [WebTools for Mac][2].

## <a id="step-4"></a>Calendar

Choose one of the following options:

* [!include[SuperOffice Inbox](includes/so-inbox-for-invitations.md)]

* [!include[Synchronizer](includes/why-synchronizer.md)]

* [WebTools for Mac][2] - to export your SuperOffice diary to your iCalendar and copy your SuperOffice contacts to your Address Book.

    > [!NOTE]
