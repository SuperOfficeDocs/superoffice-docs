# Microsoft 365 integration as your solution

With Microsoft 365 as your solution, there are several ways to connect your email account, documents, and calendar to SuperOffice.

## Email ![icon][img1]

[!include[Why](includes/why-connect-email.md)]

Choose one of the following options:

* [SuperOffice Inbox][1] (default)

    [!include[ALT](includes/set-up-inbox.md)]

* [!include[ALT](includes/why-superoffice-for-outlook.md)]

    [!include[Go to App Store](../../../email/superoffice-for-outlook/learn/includes/install.md)]

## Document ![icon][img2]

The **SharePoint document library** lets you store all documents in SharePoint Online.

You can save a document in SuperOffice CRM and open it in either SuperOffice CRM or SharePoint. The document will also be stored on the correct customer card in SuperOffice CRM for other users to see. You can also share it via a SharePoint link with those who do not use SuperOffice CRM.

> [!NOTE]
> This option requires a Microsoft 365 subscription and is available only if your administrator has [set up the Microsoft Sharepoint document library][5]. Alternatively, use SuperOffice document library with WebTools (or Google Workspace).

## Diary and invitations ![icon][img3]

Choose one of the following options:

* [SuperOffice Inbox][1] (default)

    [!include[Note](includes/note-step-completed.md)]

* [!include[ALT](includes/why-synchronizer.md)]
