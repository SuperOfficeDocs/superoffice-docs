# Enable Google Workspace integration

The free Google Workspace integration app for documents enables you to work effortlessly with documents from SuperOffice CRM. Learn more about the Workspace document integration app in this how-to guide.

The Google Workspace app (previously called Google G Suite integration) integrates Workspace’s document management function with SuperOffice CRM, so that you can create, store, and find documents in SuperOffice CRM.

The app also enables the single sign-on that allows you to sign in to SuperOffice CRM using your Google Workspace login details.

## The set-up steps

To start using the integration, you need to take 2 set-up steps:

* Set up [Google Workspace][1] to integrate to SuperOffice CRM Online
* Configure the document templates for use, as documented in the article “[Configure - Cloud Office document handling][2]”.

> [!NOTE]
> You may need administrative rights to SuperOffice CRM, depending on your organisation’s security settings, in order to make systems connections.
