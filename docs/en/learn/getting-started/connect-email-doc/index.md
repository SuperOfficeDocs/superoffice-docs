# Connect email, document, and calendar

Connecting your emails, documents, and calendar to SuperOffice will help you work more efficiently and make it easier to collaborate with your colleagues. It lets you:

* Share all communication you have with your customers and contacts, including emails and files, internally.
* Have all your follow-ups in SuperOffice linked to the correct contact.
* Handle incoming and outgoing invitations.
* Get your iCal events to show up in your SuperOffice diary.

## What to connect?

|-|---|---|---|
| <i class="ph ph-at" aria-hidden="true"></i> | **Email** | Archive incoming and outgoing emails.| [WebTools][4] (Windows only)<br /> [SuperOffice Inbox][6]<br /> [SuperOffice for Outlook][7]<br /> [Google Workspace (GmailLink)][9]|
