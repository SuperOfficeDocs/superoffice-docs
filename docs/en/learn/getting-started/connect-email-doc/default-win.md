# SuperOffice as your solution (Windows)

## Intro

This is the default way to connect your email account, documents, and calendar to SuperOffice.

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions are for Windows only. Are you using a Mac? See the [instructions for macOS][9].

## <a id="step-2"></a>Email

[!include[Why](includes/why-connect-email.md)]

Choose one of the following options:

* [WebTools][2] (default).

* [SuperOffice Inbox][1] - if you are unable to use WebTools.

* [!include[ALT](includes/why-superoffice-for-outlook.md)]

## <a id="step-3"></a>Document

The default document integration is **SuperOffice document library** with [WebTools][2]. If you chose WebTools for email in the previous step, you are already done.
