# The layout elements on the Main screen

SuperOffice CRM's main screen is divided into five key elements that help you navigate, manage, and view data efficiently.

## Main elements

### Navigator

The vertical row of buttons along the left edge of the screen is called the [Navigator][1]. Use these buttons to quickly navigate between different areas, such as Contacts, Companies, and Projects.

### Top bar

At the very top of the screen, the [top bar][2] provides quick access to create new records, manage personal settings, and open system options.

### Main card

The main card, located near the top of the screen, displays key details about the selected record, such as a company, contact, or project. The name of the card changes depending on the screen you are in, such as the "Company card" or "Project card."

### Side panel

On the right side of the screen, the [side panel][3] provides a flexible display for additional information, such as selection members, calendar views, or related records. You can configure its views and even resize it for better visibility.

### Section tabs

Below the main card, [section tabs][4] organize related lists, such as activities, contacts, or project members. These tabs vary depending on the screen.

These common buttons appear across SuperOffice and serve essential functions:

| Icon | Function |
|:-:|---|
| <i class="ph ph-magnifying-glass" aria-label="Search"></i> | Open the search window to find records. |
| <i class="ph ph-phone" aria-label="Phone"></i> | Choose a telephone number to dial. |
| <i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Chevron"></i> | Expand or collapse lists. |
| <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> | Access a menu of actions for the current dialog or screen. |

## Customize screen elements

### Resize panels or tabs

You can adjust the size of the main card, side panel, and section tabs to better fit your workflow. For example, if you have many activities, you can expand the section tabs to view more details.

**Steps:**

1. Hover your mouse between two elements.
2. Click and drag to adjust the size (<i class="ph ph-arrows-horizontal" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="ph ph-arrows-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>).
3. Release the mouse when the layout looks good.

> [!NOTE]
> If you shrink an element too much, some content may become hidden. Enlarge the element to make all information visible again.

### Rearrange tabs

You can reorder tabs or section tabs to suit your preferences. For example, move the **Sales** section tab to the left in the Diary screen.

**Steps:**

1. Click and drag the tab to the desired position.
2. Release the tab. SuperOffice CRM will remember your arrangement for the next time you open that view.

## Adjust font size

To change the font size, use your browser's zoom functionality (Ctrl + "+" or Ctrl + "-") to increase or decrease the font size.
