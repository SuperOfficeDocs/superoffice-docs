# The layout elements on the Main screen

The user interface has five main elements:

* **The Navigator**
    The vertical row of buttons along the left edge of the screen is called [the Navigator][1]. These buttons make it easy to navigate around in SuperOffice CRM.

* **The Top bar**
    At the very top of the screen is the Top bar. The [buttons on the menu bar][2] give fast and easy access to creating new records and activities, and managing personal settings and various system options.

* **The Main card**
    Towards the top of the screen, just to the right of the Navigator, is the main card. Here you find all the main details of companies, contacts, projects, sales, selections, and so on. The main card is named according to the screen you are in, such as Company card, Diary card, or Project card.

* **The Side panel**
    At the right side of the screen is the [side panel][3]. The side panel is a flexible display window that can be configured in lots of different ways.

* **The Section tabs**
    The section tabs appear below the main card. These contain, for example, lists of contacts, project members and activities that are linked to the relevant record in the main card.

  * [In the Company screen][10]
  * [In the Contact screen][11]
  * [In the Project screen][15]
  * [In the Sale screen][17]
  * [List of selection members][19]
  * [Activities][13]

## <a id="global-buttons"></a>Global buttons

The global buttons appear throughout the user interface. Some are in the main screen, while others are in the various dialogs.

| Button | Function |
|---|---|
| <i class="ph ph-magnifying-glass" aria-label="Search"></i> | Used to open the search window. |
| <i class="ph ph-phone" aria-label="Phone"></i> | Used to choose a telephone number to dial. |
| <i class="ph ph-caret-down" aria-label="Chevron"></i> | Arrows open and close lists. |
| <i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-label="Task menu"></i> | Used to open a menu containing tasks relevant to the dialog or screen. |

## Change the size of screen elements

You can change the size of the main card, the side panel and the section tabs. If, for example, you have many activities, you can expand the section tabs in the Company, Contact, Sale and Project screens, so that more activities can be displayed at a time. Different screens may have different settings, and SuperOffice CRM will remember the settings for a screen the next time it is displayed.

**Steps:**

1. Position the mouse pointer between the screen elements you want to resize.
2. Click and drag to the required size (<i class="ph ph-split-horizontal" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="ph ph-split-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>).
3. When the elements are the size you want them to be, release the mouse button.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make the screen elements too small, information in the screen will be hidden. Because there is no scroll-bar in these elements, you must enlarge the screen to view all the information again.

## Change the position of screen elements

You can change the positioning of the tabs and section tabs to meet your needs. For example, if you want the **Sales** section tab to be displayed on the left in the diary in the place of **Activities**.

1. Click and drag the tab/section tab to where you want it.
2. Release the tab/section tab. SuperOffice CRM remembers your choice, and displays it as you specified the next time you open the view.
