# The side panel

The side panel is a multifunctional panel located rightmost on every screen in SuperOffice (except for the Inbox).

Use the side panel to view and use information from other parts of your CRM solution. For example, to work your way through lists of contacts to call, sales to update, or sales proposals to follow up. You can choose from different views by clicking the ![icon][img3] arrow next to the side panel's name.

![The side panel is located on the right side of SuperOffice CRM -screenshot][img10]

> [!TIP]
> You can minimize the side-panel by clicking the ![icon][img4] minimize icon on the upper right corner, to get more room for the main cards and archives.

The side panel is useful for showing information complementary to the screen you are in. For example, you can display the monthly calendar at the same time as you are viewing the daily calendar in the Diary screen, to give you a better overview, or you can show the members of a selection linked to a project you are looking at in the Project screen. You can also add custom views to the side panel, from Settings and Maintenance.

By default, the side panel shows a preview of the selected record. After you have selected a view in a tab in a screen, SuperOffice CRM remembers this the next time the same tab is displayed.

## Company

Shows a summary of information about the current company in the Company screen.

> [!TIP]
> To view other companies, without having to switch companies in the Company screen, click the arrow next to the company name to open the [history list][1]

## Contact

Shows information about the contact selected in the **Company** or Selection screen.

> [!TIP]
> Click the contact's name to open the [contact card][2] where you can view and edit detailed information about the contact.

### Why is the side panel empty?

In a [dynamic selection][7], you can choose to show companies only, without specifying a contact. If **Include main contact** is not chosen for the dynamic selection, no information is displayed in the Contact view for the side panel, even if you selected a contact.

## Day

Shows a day's agenda. Works in the same way as the [Day][3] tab in the [Diary][4] screen

> [!NOTE]
> You can show only your own diary in the side panel. To view other people's diaries, go to the [Diary][4] screen.

## Next day

Show a daily agenda for the next day. This works in the same way as the **Day** view.

## Week

Shows a weekly agenda, giving you an overview of follow-ups for the current week.

## Month

Shows a monthly agenda, giving you an overview of follow-ups for the next month(s). You can expand the side panel to show multiple months.

If you hold the mouse pointer over these days, a tooltip containing a list of the relevant follow-ups appears.

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon][img7] | The "bar" below the date indicates the level of activities that day, making it easier to schedule meetings. |
| ![icon][img8] | Today. |
| ![icon][img9] | The selected date in the Diary. |

You can move from month to month by clicking the ![icon][img1] ![icon][img2] arrow icons at the bottom of the side panel.

## My favorites

Shows all your [favorites][8].

* To view only favorites for the current screen, click the checkbox at the bottom of the side panel. Example: If the Sale screen is open, click **Sales only** to show only sales.
* To remove favorites, select one or more favorites in the list and click **Remove**.
* Click **Refresh** to update the list of favorites.
* Right-click a favorite to open the context menu.

## Notepad

Opens the [Notepad][9] in the side panel.

## Preview

Shows a preview of a selected activity, project, contact, project member or selection member in the side panel. Depending on the selected item, the window may contain links to contacts and activities. Clicking one of these links opens the [contact card][2], [Document dialog][5], or [follow-ups dialog][6], where you can view and edit the contact or activity.
