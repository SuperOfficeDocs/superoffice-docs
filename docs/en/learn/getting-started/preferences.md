# Change a preference

You can specify settings for different parts of SuperOffice CRM, for example, the number of items to display in the history list and the default currency for sales. All preference settings are defined in Settings and maintenance, but users can modify some individually in SuperOffice CRM.

## Steps

1. Choose ![icon][img12] **Personal settings** > **Preferences**.

2. In the **Preferences** dialog, select the required preference from the list on the left.

3. Enter the required setting in the window on the right.
