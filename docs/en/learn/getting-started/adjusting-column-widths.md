# Adjust column widths

There are different lists in SuperOffice CRM, for example, the **Contacts** and **Activities** section tabs. The width of the columns in lists like these can be adjusted manually or automatically.

## Manually adjust column widths

1. Hold the mouse pointer over the vertical dividing line to the left or right of a column heading. The mouse pointer changes into a double vertical line with arrows.
2. Click down with the mouse button and drag the divider in the required direction to increase or decrease the column width. The column widths you set are retained between sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot adjust column widths manually if **Auto-fit column width** is active.

## Automatically adjust column widths

You can set columns widths to be adjusted automatically according to the content of the columns. When columns are added or removed, all column widths are adjusted to a best fit every time. If there are too many columns to fit within the available space, a horizontal scrollbar is displayed.

1. Go to the section tab you want to edit.
2. Click ![icon][img1] on the far right of the column headers in a section tab. A dialog is displayed.
3. Select **Auto-fit column width**.
4. Click **OK**.
