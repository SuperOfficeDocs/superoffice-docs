# Restore deleted companies and contacts

You can restore companies and contacts that have been deleted by mistake, either by yourself or another user. Deleted companies and contacts are by default kept in the recycle bin for 14 days. After this time, they are permanently deleted.

1. Choose ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Recycle bin**.

2. In the **Recycle bin** dialog, select the **Company** or **Contact** tab. Companies and contacts deleted by you are displayed.

3. Optional: Select **View deleted companies/contacts for all users**. This option requires functional rights.

4. Select the companies or contacts you want to restore.
    * Restoring a company will also restore all contacts associated with this company.
    * Restoring a contact where the company too was deleted, will restore the company and the selected contact.

5. Click **Restore**. The companies and contacts are restored in SuperOffice.
