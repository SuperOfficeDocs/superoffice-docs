# Grouping lists

You can group a list on one or more data types to get a better overview of the records in a section tab.

**Examples**: Group a list of **activities** on category, so you can view all your appointments or web forms. Group a list of **requests** on category and status, so you can get an overview of request statuses per category.

* To activate the grouping, click ![icon][img1] on the far right of the column headers in a section tab and click **Enable grouping**. A new row is now displayed above the column headers.

* To group a list, click and drag a column header to the row above the column headers. The list now displays a row per value in the selected column. If you selected a category column, each available category in the column is displayed on a separate row. Click the row to expand the group and show the records.

* To group on a second value, repeat the procedure above.

* To ungroup, click X on a value.
