# Filter activities and sales

![icon][img1]

At the bottom of the **Activities** and **Sales** section tabs in the **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale** and **Project** screens is the **Filter** button.

You use the filter function to specify which records to display on the **Activities** and **Sales** section tabs. You do this by specifying a date range for the records you want to see. The default in the **Filter** dialog is to display the previous year’s and the next six months’ activities or sales of the user currently logged in, but you can change these values as described below.

In addition to defining a time period, you can also choose if you want to see all the activities or sales that are defined in the organization, or only your own. You can also specify that you want to see information created by one or more user groups or by specific people.

## Use the Filter function

1. Go to the **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale** or **Project** screen. (See [Use the Find screen][1].)

2. Select the **Activities** or **Sales** section tab.

3. Click the **Filter** button ( ![icon][img1] ).

4. In the **From** box, specify from how far back in time you want to show activities or sales.

5. In the **To** box, specify for how far ahead in time you want to show activities or sales.

    > [!TIP]
    > Click the arrow to the right of the **To** box to open a list of possible time intervals. Using this list you can choose, for example, to show all activities or sales defined for the next quarter.

6. You now have the following options:
    * To show the activities or sales for a specific group, select the required group in the **Groups** list. The members in the group will then be selected for you on the **Associates** list on the right.
    * To show activities or sales for one or more associates, simply select the required contacts in the **Associates** list. To select several at once, hold down the **CTRL** key as you select the people you want.
    * To show your own activities or sales, click the **Mine** button.
    * To show all activities or sales for all groups and associates, click the **All** button.

7. When you have chosen a time interval, group(s) and associate(s), click **OK**. The **Activities** or **Sales** section tabs will then show all activities or sales that match the criteria you specified in the **Filter** dialog.

Hold the mouse pointer over the **Filter** button ![icon][img1] to display the active filter settings.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Activities** tab, you can also use pre-defined filters for documents, follow-ups, chats/forms (other) and mailings. See [Use filters in the section tabs][2].

Click **Show count** at the bottom right of the section tab, to see how many records are displayed. The number changes according to active filter(s).
