# Configure columns

You can customize the lists in the section tabs in SuperOffice CRM to display precisely the information you need. You can change which columns are displayed, as well as their order.

## Change the order of the columns

To change the order of the columns in a section tab, click and drag a column header to a new location.

## Adding or removing columns

1. Go to the section tab you want to edit.
2. Click ![icon][img1] on the far right of the column headers in a section tab. A dialog is displayed.
3. Select or deselect the relevant columns. Use the **Filter columns** fields to filter the columns that are displayed.
4. Click **OK**.

To reset the columns to the default view, click **Reset**.
