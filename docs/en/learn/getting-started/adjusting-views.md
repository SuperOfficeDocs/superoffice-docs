# Adjust views

Below is a description of how to adjust different views in Settings and maintenance.

## Move tabs

Many of the screens in Settings and maintenance consist of different tabs (such as **Options** and **Users**). You can change the order of these tabs:

1. Click and drag the tab to the required position.
2. Release the tab.

> [!NOTE]
> The descriptions of the tabs in this help follow their default order.

## Sort lists

* Click the column heading you want to sort by, or right-click on a column heading and choose **Sort**.
* Click the column heading once more to sort in reverse order.
* Right-click a column heading, and select **Configure sort order**. In the dialog that appears, you can select more sorting columns.

## Adjust column widths

There are different list views in Settings and maintenance, for example, lists of preferences, lists of lists and lists of user-defined fields. To adjust the column widths in these views:

1. Hold the mouse pointer over the vertical dividing line to the left or right of a column heading. The mouse pointer changes into a double vertical line with arrows ( ![icon][img3] ).
2. Click and drag the divider in the required direction to increase or decrease the column width.

The columns will retain the specified widths the next time you run the program.

## Change the column view

You can select which columns are displayed in the lists, as well as their order.

1. Right-click a column heading, and select **Configure columns**. The **Columns** tab in the **Customize** dialog is displayed.

2. Make the required changes in the columns:

    * Add columns: In the **Available columns** pane, select the columns you want to add and click the right arrow ( ![icon][img1] ) to move them to the **Columns selected** pane.

    * Remove columns: In the **Columns selected** pane, select the columns you want to remove and click the left arrow ( ![icon][img2] ) to move them to the **Available columns** pane.

    * Change the order of the columns: In the **Columns selected** pane, select the column that you want to move left or right in the view and click either the up arrow ( ![icon][img4] ) or the down arrow ( ![icon][img5] ).

3. Click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> To reset the column layout, click **Reset** at the bottom of the **Columns selected** pane.
