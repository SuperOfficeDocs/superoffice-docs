# External applications and URL addresses

You can have shortcuts to external applications and URL addresses in SuperOffice CRM, so that you can open them directly from within the program. The applications and URL addresses available in SuperOffice CRM, and how they are accessed, are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

> [!NOTE]
> In this context, applications means any type of file, not just program files.

Linked applications and URL addresses that you have access to in SuperOffice CRM can be displayed in the following places:

* Under the **Other applications** option on the ![icon][img1] **Main menu**: Click the name of the required application/URL address to open it.

* Via the Navigator: Some applications/URL addresses are displayed with their own icons in the Navigator; to open them, simply click the icon or name.

* Via **Tools** in the Navigator: When you click the word **Tools** or the ![icon][img2] icon, a list of any linked applications/URL addresses is displayed. Click the name of the required application/URL address to open it.

> [!NOTE]
> Tools must be configured in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

* Via the **WWW** tab in the **Company** screen (configured in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance): URL addresses can be displayed at the top of the **WWW** tab in the form of links that you can click to open the appropriate address.
* Via extra section tabs in the **Company** and **Project** screens: You can add a URL address as an extra section tab to the **Company**, **Contact**, **Project** and/or **Sale** screens. You then open the URL address by clicking the tab itself.
