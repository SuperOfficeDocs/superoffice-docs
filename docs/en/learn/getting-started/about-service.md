# SuperOffice Service

SuperOffice Service is a web-based system for handling customer requests. The core of the system is the **Requests** module. All communication concerning a specific request is stored in a single location, regardless of it is by email, web form, phone or another channel. In this way, the organization ensures that all requests are followed up, and that no enquiries sit unanswered in the users' own inboxes.

Requests can be categorized, prioritized and routed. Most importantly, all communication with a customer can be tracked, so that users can always maintain an overview of each customer relationship. The system also has other modules and functions associated with the Requests module.

For example, there is an internal knowledge base consisting of reply templates and FAQs. This data can be used for look-up, or users can make them available to customers. It is also possible to link SuperOffice Service to an external customer portal where the customer can follow-up their requests. Using a customer portal, customers can also have access to FAQs, so that they can find answers to their queries without having to contact a request handler.
