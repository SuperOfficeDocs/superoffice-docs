# The section tabs

The section tabs appear below the main card. These contain, for example, lists of contacts, project members, sales and activities that are linked to the relevant record in the main card.

> [!TIP]
> Press the up/down arrow buttons on your keyboard to move up and down in the list. Press **ENTER** to open a record.

## Change the number of records in a list

Some lists may contain hundreds of records. To prevent slow loading of long lists, only a specified number of records are displayed when opening a section tab. To show all records, click **Show all** at the bottom of the section tab.

1. Go to the section tab you want to edit.
2. Click ![icon][img1] on the far right of the column headers in a section tab. A dialog is displayed.
3. Click the **Page size** list and select a value.
4. Click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also adjust settings for the section tabs in [Preferences][1].
