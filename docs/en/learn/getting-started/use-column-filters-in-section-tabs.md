# Use column filters in the section tabs

You can filter the content of section tabs by adding criteria to one or more columns.

> The column filter is not available in all section tabs. Not all columns can be filtered.

## Activate the column filter

To activate the column filter, click ![icon][img1] on the far right of the column headers in a section tab and click **Enable filter**. The filter button (![icon][img2]) is now displayed on columns that can be filtered.

## Apply filters on column

1. Click the column filter button ( ![icon][img2] ) next to a column header.
2. Depending on the type of data in the column, do one of the following:
    * Enter text and click **ENTER**. The default filter type is "starts with".
    * Select an item from the list.
    * Select a date range.
3. Click **Filter**. The section tab is updated with the records that match the filter. Filtered columns are displayed in bold text.
4. Repeat the previous step to filter by a second column.

## Reset the column filter

Click ![icon][img1] and **Reset** to reset the filter.
