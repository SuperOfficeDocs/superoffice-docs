# Tooltips

In many places in SuperOffice CRM, a tooltip is used to show more information about an item. This function is especially useful with lists to see more than the main information displayed for individual records, or, with narrow columns, to display more than the truncated information. The tooltip is displayed when you hold the mouse pointer over an item.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to access a function, a text is displayed explaining why you cannot see the information in question.
