# Refresh data

Each time you start SuperOffice CRM, the program is completely updated with all the changes other people have made in the main database and changes that have been made in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

You can also refresh the data while you are using SuperOffice CRM. You do this by clicking **F5**.

> [!NOTE]
> Some changes in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance require a restart of the SuperOffice CRM client for the changes to take effect.
