# Change the size and positioning of screen elements

## Change the size

You can change the size of the main card, the side panel and the section tabs. If, for example, you have many activities, you can expand the section tabs in the **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale** and **Project** screens, so that more activities can be displayed at a time. Different screens may have different settings, and SuperOffice CRM will remember the settings for a screen the next time it is displayed.

**Steps:**

1. Position the mouse pointer between the screen elements you want to resize.
2. Click ![icon][img1] or ![icon][img2] and drag to the required size.
3. When the elements are the size you want them to be, release the mouse button.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make the screen elements too small, information in the screen will be hidden. Since there is no scroll-bar in these elements, you must enlarge the screen to view all the information again.

## Change the positioning

You can change the positioning of the tabs and section tabs to meet your needs. For example, if you want the **Sales** section tab to be displayed on the left in the diary in the place of **Activities**.

1. Click and drag the tab/section tab to where you want it.
2. Release the tab/section tab. SuperOffice CRM remembers your choice, and displays it as you specified the next time you open the view.

## Font type and size

Zoom in/out in the browser to get larger/smaller font.
