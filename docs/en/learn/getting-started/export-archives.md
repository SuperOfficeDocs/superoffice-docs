# Export section tabs

You can export all section tabs containing records in SuperOffice CRM to an Excel file, if this option is enabled in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance for your user. In that case, an ![icon][img2] **Export** button appears at the bottom of all section tabs containing records and under the results pane in the **Find** screen.

> [!TIP]
> You can also [export selections][3] to Excel using the **Export to Excel** task.

## Before you export

* [Configure columns][1]. Select which columns you want to include in the export and their order.
* [Filter the records in the section][2] tab to display only the data you want to export. Filtering is not available in all sections tabs.

## Export a section tab

1. Select the records you want to export, and click the ![icon][img2] **Export** button. If you select no records, all will be exported.
2. Microsoft Excel opens with the specified records entered into a new spreadsheet.
3. Save the spreadsheet wherever you want.

> [!NOTE]
> If you know that this function was enabled in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, but you cannot see the ![icon][img2] **Export** button at the bottom of the section tabs, go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Functions** > **Show Export button in the section tabs** and select **Yes**.
