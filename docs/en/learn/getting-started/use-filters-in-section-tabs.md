# Use filters in the section tabs

The section tabs in SuperOffice CRM can contain large amounts of data, such as contacts, activities, sales and so on. To make it easier to show the data you want to work with, you can filter theses lists to your specific needs.

![Use filters in the section tabs -screenshot][img1]

> [!NOTE]
> Multiple filters can be active at the same time. If a section tab does not display the expected records, check your filter settings.

The following filtering options are available in the section tabs:

* The **Filter** button ![icon][img2] : You can filter the **Activities** and **Sales** section tabs by date, users and groups. See [Filter activities and sales][2].
* Activities filters (check-boxes): You can filter the **Activities** section tabs by activity type. Click the arrow and select check-boxes to show/hide mailings, documents, follow-ups and forms/chats (**Other**) in the list.
* The column filter ![icon][img3] : Click the column filter button ![icon][img3] on a column header to [filter on that column][1].
* To filter the list of members in the **Selection** screen, see [Filtering the List of Members][3].
* To filter the **Documents** section tab in the **Reports** screen, see [Use the Filter function in the Reports screen][4].
