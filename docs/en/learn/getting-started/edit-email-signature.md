# Edit email signature

> [!NOTE]
  > The default signature template contains [template variables][3] for your name, company, address, phone numbers, email address, website, and so on. The variables are replaced with data from your contact card, so your signature will always be updated with the correct information.

1. Click the **Personal settings** button in the Top bar.
2. Select **Edit personal signature**. This will bring up your signature dialog.
3. Select the **Email signature** tab or **Request signature** tab.
4. Edit the signature by deleting or adding information.
5. Click ![icon][img2] to open the text editor toolbar. Here you have various options for editing text and adding additional content.
6. Click ![icon][img3] in the toolbar to add variables, or go to [template variables][3] for the complete list of available variables.
7. Add images and links using the buttons in the toolbar. You can also drag and drop links and images. Use the **Insert link** button to add links to social media.
8. Click **Save** when you are done.
9. Optional: Test the signature by sending an email to yourself or by creating a new request. Check that all information is displayed correctly, and the links work and images are displayed as intended.
