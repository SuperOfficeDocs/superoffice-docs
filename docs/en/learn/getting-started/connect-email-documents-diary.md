Connecting your email, your documents and your diary to SuperOffice CRM will help you work more effectively and make it easier to collaborate with your colleagues. Learn which integration options you need based on your operating system, email client, and the document programs you use in this how-to guide.

## Save email in SuperOffice CRM

With SuperOffice it is easy to save important emails in your CRM database. Just hit the archive button in your email client, and the email integration will let you save the message on any company, contact, activity, sale, or project in your database for easy access.

[How to archive your email][1]

> [!TIP]

If colleagues ask for information from one of these emails, just ask them to look up the relevant contact card and find your email on the Activities tab.
