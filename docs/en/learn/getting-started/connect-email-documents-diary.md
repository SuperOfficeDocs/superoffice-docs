Connecting your email, your documents and your diary to SuperOffice CRM will help you work more effectively and make it easier to collaborate with your colleagues. Learn which integration options you need based on your operating system, email client, and the document programs you use in this how-to guide.

## Save email in SuperOffice CRM

[How to archive your email][1]

> [!TIP]

If colleagues ask for information from one of these emails, just ask them to look up the relevant contact card and find your email on the Activities tab.
