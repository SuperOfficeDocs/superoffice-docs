# Merge contacts

You can merge two or more contacts. For example, if a contact was registered in two different companies and also without a company, you can merge these contacts into one contact for the correct company. Any requests linked to the contacts are kept.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also search for and select contacts to merge from the search results screen. Then click ![icon][img1] in the lower left corner and select **Batch management** > **Merge**.

**Steps:**

1. Open one of the contacts you want to merge.

2. Click ![icon][img1] and select **Merge**. A screen opens, showing the fields that must be merged. Now you need to find the contact to merge with this one.

3. In the search field, start typing the contact's name. Enter **%** to display all contacts.

4. Select a contact from the list of search results. The selected contact opens in a new column in the table.

5. To add more contacts, repeat the previous steps.

6. For each row (field) in the table, you must select which contact data should be kept. Click ![icon][img2] **Choose** to select all fields in a column. The unselected data in this table will be overwritten.
    * Requests from all merged contacts will be kept.
    * Email addresses from all merged contacts will be kept, but you must edit the merged contact to set the correct primary email address.

7. Click **OK**. The contacts are merged.

8. Open the merged contact and check that the data was merged correctly. Set the correct primary email address.

The contacts that were overwritten will no longer be available in favorites and history lists and search.
