# Create contacts

Normally, contacts are registered by the system when they send in mails, but there may occasionally be a need to register a contact manually. For example, if you are talking to a contact on the phone.

1. Select **Customers** > **New contact**. This takes you to the **Contact properties** screen.

2. Enter the contact's first name and last name.

3. In the **New email address** field, enter the address itself to the left and a name to identify the email address (for example, work, private) in the field on the right.

4. Click ![icon][img1] to add the email address. You can add multiple addresses.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can delete an email address by clicking **Delete** (![icon][img2]) on the right of the row.

5. Enter the phone number and/or mobile number.

6. In the **Country** field, select the contact's country.

7. In the **Preferred language** field, select the contact's language. This is the preferred language for all reply templates sent to the contact. This option is only available if the language module is installed.

8. In the **Mr/Ms** field, select a salutation.

9. In the **User name** and **Password** fields, enter the information the contact has to use when logging in to any customer centre. The user name is normally the email address. If you enter nothing in these fields, the user name and password are generated automatically by the system.

10. In the **Priority** field, select the default priority for new requests linked to this contact. Normally you select **(None)** here. The system will then use the priority for the company which the contact is linked to. Alternatively you can select between **Low**, **Medium** and **High** or any custom priority.

11. In the **Our service contact** field, select the request handler who will be responsible for this contact. Normally you select **(None)** here. The system will then use the request handler which is responsible for the company that the contact is linked to.

12. If the contact is associated with a company, the following fields have already been filled in with values from the associated company and cannot be edited:
    * In the **Our Contact**field, your name is displayed automatically. Clicking the arrow brings up a list box where you can choose the name of someone else from your organization.
    * In the **Category**field, select the category the contact belongs to, from a predefined list of categories. Click the arrow to show the category list.
    * In the **Business**field, select from a list of different predefined types of business. Click the arrow and choose the business that best matches the contact you are creating.

13. In the **Company** field, you can specify which company the contact is linked to. To search for a company, start typing its name, and select the company from the list of results.
    Click ![icon][img3] to [create a new company][1].

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also click **Automatic** to select a company automatically based on the domain in the email address (what appears after "@"). The domain must be registered on a company.

14. Check **Company access** if the contact is to have access to all requests registered for all contacts of the company in question, for example via a customer centre.

15. In the **Notes** field, you can add any additional information about the contact.

16. Click **OK**. The contact is saved.
