# Delete companies

If you delete a company, it is not completely removed from the system. It is just marked as deleted.

1. Open the **Company** screen.
2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Actions** button and select **Edit company**. The **Company properties** screen appears.
3. Click **Delete**.
4. Click **OK** to confirm.

    The company is marked as deleted, but any associated contacts are not affected by this deletion.

> [!TIP]
> To undo the deletion of a company, follow the same procedure, but the button then becomes **Activate** instead of **Delete**.
