# Guides for SuperOffice CRM

## A platform for revenue growth

SuperOffice CRM is your one platform for business growth. With all standard applications connected to the same customer base, SuperOffice CRM combines all your customer-facing processes – sales, marketing and customer service – into one technology stack.

## SuperOffice CRM - Core system

Whether you’re a marketer, a sales rep or a support agent – SuperOffice CRM is built for everyone. Our set of core features helps all teams organise their contact information, keep all data in one place, manage tasks, documents and emails, and follow up with customers!

A system to manage and follow up all contacts, sales and projects. The core of the system are the Company card and Contact card. All information and communication concerning a company and contact are stored in these cards.

These guides provides you with comprehensive user assistance for the following SuperOffice modules:

## SuperOffice Sales

Sales is a game of persistence, planning, and time. Built on 30+ years of experience in optimising sales processes, SuperOffice CRM is designed to help you do more with your most valuable asset – time. SuperOffice Sales gives you the right tools to focus on managing your pipeline, improving forecasts, working smarter, developing profitable customer relationships, and simply – closing more deals.

## SuperOffice Service

SuperOffice Service gives all your customer-facing teams a 360-degree view of the customer, with all critical data in one place. That means complete control over all interactions and touchpoints – and that means streamlined processes, lower response times, and more time to focus on what matters. Ready to exceed customer expectations?

A system for handling customer requests/tickets. The core of the system is the Requests module. All communication concerning a specific request is stored in a single location, regardless of it is by email, web form, phone or another channel.

## SuperOffice Marketing

We believe that every engagement with a customer presents an opportunity – if you treat it right. SuperOffice Marketing is designed to help your marketing teams send the right message to the right customers at the right time. We give you the tools to automate and personalise communication, reach your target audience better, and initiate meaningful conversations that turn into revenue.

SuperOffice Marketing is concerned with outbound communication and forms. You can send bulk mailings by email or SMS to all or parts of your customer base, for example to inform customers about upgrades or product news. Use forms for product/newsletter registration, consent management and data updates.

## Settings and maintenance

Settings and maintenance is the administration module for SuperOffice CRM. The navigator buttons in Settings and maintenance activate their associated functions with a single click, making it easy to navigate quickly between the different parts of the system.
