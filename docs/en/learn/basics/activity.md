## <a id="view" />View activities

The activities displayed depend on which filters you select at the bottom of the section tab. You can show all activities, or just one of the types. Click the ![icon][img5] **Filter** button to [filter activities][17] by date and user.

## Columns

The activities list columns contain the following information:

* ![icon][img1]: The first column in the activities list specifies the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.

* The Category column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a calendar for a meeting. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.

* The other columns in the activities list show various information about the activity. If not all the text in a field is visible, hold the mouse pointer over it to display it in a tooltip.

## Create activity

You create activities using the **New** menu in the top bar, or by clicking **Add** button in the section tab.

## <a id="delete" />Delete activity

You can delete activities from any screen where they are displayed:

1. Select one or more activities that you want to delete.

2. Right-click the selected activity or activities and select **Delete**.

3. When asked if you really want to delete the activity, click **Yes**.
