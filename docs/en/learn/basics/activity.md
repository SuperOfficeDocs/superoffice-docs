## Columns

The activities list columns contain the following information:

* ![icon][img1]: The first column in the activities list specifies the **Completed** status of an activity. A tick means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.

* The Category column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a calendar for a meeting. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.

* The other columns in the activities list show various information about the activity. If not all the text in a field is visible, hold the mouse pointer over it to display it in a tooltip.

## Create activity

You create activities using the **New** menu in the top bar, or by clicking **Add** button in the section tab.

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete activity

You can delete activities from any screen where they are displayed:

1. Select one or more activities that you want to delete.

2. Right-click the selected activity or activities and select **Delete**.

3. When asked if you really want to delete the activity, click **Yes**.
