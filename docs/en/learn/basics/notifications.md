# Notifications

When you click on the **bell icon** ![icon][img1] in the upper-right corner of SuperOffice, the notifications panel appears as an overlay, showing the latest occurrences at the top. Here you can do the following:

* Click a list item to open it.
* Click ![icon][img2] to set your notification preferences.
* Click **Clear all** in the footer of the notification pane to clear the list of notifications. You can also click **Got it** below a notification to remove it.

## <a id="activity" />Activity notifications

When you receive an activity notification, it will appear in your notifications panel. Click the link in the notification to open the activity.

These are the different activity notifications:

* **New meeting**: Respond by clicking **Accept** or **Decline**. Once you have responded, the invitation will disappear from notifications panel.

* **New recurring meeting**: If the invitation is for a recurring event, this will be reflected with an occurring icon ![icon][img4] below the link.

* **Meeting has changed**: If the time or date of a meeting you have already accepted changes, you will receive a new notification letting you know what has changed and requiring you accept or decline it.

* **Meeting cancelled**: The meeting is cancelled. Click the link to open the calendar item, or click **Got it** to remove it from your notifications.

* **Invitation declined**: A meeting attendee has declined the invitation. Click the link to open the calendar item, or click **Got it** to remove it from your notifications.

> [!NOTE]
> Invitations and changed activities will not be removed from the notifications panel but will remain until you either **Accept** or **Decline** the invitation.

## Request notifications

When something changes on a request that you are associated with, a notification will appear in the notifications panel. Click the link in the notification to open the request.

These are the different request notifications:

* **New request**: A new request has been received.
* **New message in request**: There is a new message in a request.
* **Request escalated**: A request has been escalated to the next escalation level.
* **Request activated**: A request has been activated.
* **Request taken over**: Someone has taken over one of your requests.
* **Favourited request updated**: One of your favourite requests has been updated.
* **Custom message**: A custom message has been added to a request.

> [!NOTE]
> The list of request notifications is cleared every night, meaning that any request notifications you have in your list at the end of the day will not be there tomorrow.
