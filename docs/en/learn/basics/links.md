# Links

Use the **Links** tab to connect relevant activities, sales, projects, documents, or websites to a record. For example, if you are going to a meeting with a company you have previously communicated with, you can add links to documents and sales you have already created for this company.

## Where the Links tab is available

The **Links** tab can be found in:

* [Project screen][1]
* [Sale screen][2]
* [Follow-up dialog][3]
* [Document dialog][4]

A dot appears next to the **Links** tab when it contains one or more links.

    * **Select link target**:
      * For **URL**, enter the website address.
      * For other link types, select a record from the list or type to search.
    * **Enter a description**: This will be the visible link text.

1. Click **OK**.

1. Click **Save** to store all changes.

1. Go to the **Links** tab.
1. Click **Edit**.
