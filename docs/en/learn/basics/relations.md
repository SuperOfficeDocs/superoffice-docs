# Company and contact relations in SuperOffice CRM

Relations in SuperOffice CRM allow you to establish connections between companies and contacts. Relations always consist of two parties: one active and one passive. For example, "Company A owns Company B," where Company A is the active party and Company B is the passive. This guide provides an overview of how to view, add, and manage these relationships, making it easier to track complex structures, associations, or any custom relationships your business requires.

## Examples of relations

Examples include ownership structures, partnership agreements, or personal relationships between contacts.

| Type | Active | Passive |
|---|---|---|
| Company - company | Company ABC Ltd cooperates with Consultancy Firm Co. | Consultancy ABC Ltd cooperates with Company Firm Co. |
| Company - contact | Company ABC Ltd hires Greg Campbell (Consultancy Firm Co.) | Greg Campbell (Consultancy ABC Ltd) is hired by Company Firm Co. |
| Contact - company | Peter Johnson owns Company ABC Ltd | Company ABC Ltd is owned by Peter Johnson. |
| Contact - contact | Mark Johnson (Consultancy Firm Co.) is the son of Peter Johnson (Company ABC Ltd). | Peter Johnson (Company ABC Ltd) is the father of Mark Johnson (Consultancy Firm Co.). |

## View relations
