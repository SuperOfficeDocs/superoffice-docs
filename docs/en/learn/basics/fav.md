# Favourites in SuperOffice CRM

The Favourites function provides easy access to your favourite records, such as companies, contacts, sales, selections, projects, documents, requests, and mailings.

## Add record as a favourite

[!include[Add fav](../includes/howto-add-favorite.md)]

In lists (such as the section tabs and Find), you can right-click a record and select **Add to favourites** in the menu.

To add reports as favourites, see [Favourite reports][1].

## Accessing your favourites

You can access your favourites from the following places in the application:
