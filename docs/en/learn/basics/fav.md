# Favorites in SuperOffice CRM

The Favorites function provides easy access to your favorite records, such as companies, contacts, sales, selections, projects, documents, requests, and mailings. This guide will help you understand how to use favorites effectively, from adding records to managing and removing them.

## Add record as a favorite

To add a record to favorites, click the star icon (![icon][img3]) on the relevant card, tab, or dialog. The star turns yellow, and the record is instantly added to your favorites. You do not have to click **Save**.

In lists (such as the section tabs and Find results), you can also right-click a record and select **Add to favorites** in the menu.

Now you can quickly access the record by selecting ![icon][img1] from the Navigator menu. Favorites are also available in the [side panel][4].

## Accessing your favorites

### From the Navigator

1. Click the word **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale**, **Project**, **Requests**, or **Selection** in Navigator.

1. Click ![icon][img1].

1. Select the record you want to view.

### In the side panel

1. Click the chevron icon next to the side panel's name to open the list.

1. Select **My favorites**.

1. Optionally, click the checkbox at the bottom of the side panel to show only one type of favorites. For example, if the Sale screen is open, click **Sales only** to show only favorite sales.

> [!TIP]
> Hover over a favorite to see more details.

## Remove record from the Favorites list

1. Open the record.

1. Click the favorites icon (![icon][img2]) in the header. The icon changes back to the default, indicating that the record is no longer a favorite.

## Additional tips

* **Add multiple records as favorites:** You can select multiple items in a list by holding down Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) and clicking each item, then right-click and select **Add to my favorites**.

* **Using favorites for quick navigation:** Favorites are especially useful for quickly accessing frequently used records without needing to search for them every time.
