# Favourites in SuperOffice CRM

The Favourites function provides easy access to your favourite records, such as companies, contacts, sales, selections, projects, documents, requests, and mailings.

## Add record as a favourite

[!include[Add fav](../includes/howto-add-favorite.md)]

In lists (such as the section tabs and Find), you can right-click a record and select **Add to favourites** in the menu.

To add reports as favourites, see [Favourite reports][1].

## Accessing your favourites

From the Navigator:

1. Click the word **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale**, **Project**, **Requests**, or **Selection** in Navigator.
2. Click ![icon][img1].
3. Select the item you want to view.

In the [side panel][4]:

1. Click the ![icon][img4] arrow next to the side panel's name.
2. Select **My favourites**.
3. Optionally, click the checkbox at the bottom of the side panel to show only one type of favorites. For example, if the Sale screen is open, click **Sales only** to show only favorite sales.

> [!TIP]
> If you hold the mouse pointer over a record in the favourites list, a tooltip is displayed containing additional data about the record.

## Remove item from the favourites list

1. Open the record.
