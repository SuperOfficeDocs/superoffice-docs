# Taking notes

In SuperOffice CRM, you can attach individual notes to the current company, contact, sale, project, or selection.

## Create a note

1. Go to the required company, contact, sale, selection, or project.
2. Select the **Note** tab and click **Edit**.
3. Type in the required information on the note.
4. Click **Save**.

A dot on the **Note** tab indicates that there is a note.

## Delete a note

To delete a note, simply delete all the text in the note. The dot disappears from the **Note** tab.
