# Taking notes

In SuperOffice CRM, you can attach notes to a company, contact, sale, project, or selection. These notes can be used to store any kind of information and are searchable via [Free-text search][1].

## Create a note

1. Go to the required company, contact, sale, project, or selection.

1. Select the **Note** tab and click <i class="ph ph-pencil-simple" aria-label="Edit"></i> in the upper-right corner of the card.

1. Enter the required information in the note.

1. Click **Save**.

A dot on the **Note** tab indicates that a note has been added.

## Delete a note

To delete a note, simply delete all the text in the box. The dot will disappear from the **Note** tab.
