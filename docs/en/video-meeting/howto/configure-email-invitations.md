# How to configure email invitations for video meetings

To be able to send and receive email invitations to video meetings (to/from participants), you must have configured your email setup in SuperOffice CRM (user client) or use SuperOffice Mail Link.

## With SuperOffice Inbox

1. Configure your email setup in [SuperOffice Inbox][2].
2. To be able to send the Video Meeting URL to external users, we recommend to [edit your invitation template][3] to add the new variable {burl}.

## With SuperOffice Mail Link

1. Set the [SuperOffice Mail Link][4] preference under "Invitations": 'Add / update appointments in SuperOffice...'

This feature is currently not supported if you use [Synchronizer for SuperOffice][1] - as they don't support this yet.
