# Create a video meeting

You can easily set up a video meeting when [creating a follow-up][1].

1. Go to the Follow-up dialog (example: go to the diary and create a new appointment).

2. Click ![inactive -screenshot][img1] next to the meeting type (for instance Business meeting). The icon changes to ![active -screenshot][img2] and a video meeting link is added.

    [!include[Note: user must authenticate the fist time](../includes/note-firsttime-auth-user.md)]

3. Complete the information in the dialog as described in the [Dialog for follow-ups][2].

If you have turned on email invitations for the participants of the follow-up, an email with a link to join the video meeting will be sent when the appointment is saved. In the diary, follow-ups with video meetings are displayed with the icon ![in diary -screenshot][img3].

> [!TIP]
> Click ![copy link -screenshot][img4] to copy the video meeting link. You can then paste the link in the description of the appointment or send it to others via direct messaging.
