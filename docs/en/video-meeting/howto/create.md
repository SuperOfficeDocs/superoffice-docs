# Create a video meeting

You can easily set up a video meeting when [creating a follow-up][1].

1. Go to the Follow-up dialog (example: go to the diary and create a new meeting).

2. Click <i class="ph ph-video-camera" aria-label="Video meeting"></i> next to the meeting type (for instance Business meeting). The icon changes and a video meeting link is added.

    [!include[Note: user must authenticate the fist time](../includes/note-firsttime-auth-user.md)]

3. Complete the information in the dialog.

If you have turned on email invitations for the attendees of the follow-up, an email with a link to join the video meeting will be sent when the follow-up is saved. In the diary, follow-ups with video meetings are displayed with the camera icon.

> [!TIP]
> Click <i class="ph ph-copy" aria-label="Copy"></i> to copy the video meeting link. You can then paste the link in the description of the follow-up or send it to others via direct messaging.
