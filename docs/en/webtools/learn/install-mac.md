# Install WebTools for Mac

This procedure connects Microsoft 365 and SuperOffice CRM so that you can open and edit Microsoft 365 documents directly in SuperOffice CRM on your Mac.

> [!NOTE]
> For macOS, WebTools consists of only one component: WebTools.
>
> To integrate your email, please [configure your SuperOffice Inbox][1].
