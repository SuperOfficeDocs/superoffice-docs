> [!NOTE]
> * SuperOffice only provides integration for Microsoft Office document applications, and not for Apple applications Pages, Numbers and Keynote. You need the Office package to have documents integrated.
> * Web Tools for Mac only enables a document integration, and not an email integration. If you use a Mac and want to integrate your email, please configure your SuperOffice Inbox.
