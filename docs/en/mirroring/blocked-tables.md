# Blocked tables list

All tables, except those explicitly set as “blocked” below, will be mirrored. This means that new tables in new versions of SuperOffice, as well as any customer-defined tables made in the Service product, will automatically be added.

Note that customer-defined tables can be deleted. In beta, this is not propagated. In the released version deletions will be propagated; however it is possible to create, mirror, delete, recreate and mirror a table in such a way that the schema cannot be properly updated. If that happens then the mirror will drop the table entirely and request a full repopulation.

Tables not mirrored might have a reason specified in the "reason” field. This is to help us understand why the table is not mirrored. If you have a table that is not mirrored, and you think it should be, please contact us.
