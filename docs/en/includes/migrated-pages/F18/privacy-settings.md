# How to set up privacy settings for GDPR in SuperOffice CRM

## As part of the introduction of the GDPR, every company has to outline a privacy policy. In other words, companies need to determine and document how they are going to gather, use and manage their contact's personal data.

The General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR, will come into effect on May 25th. Starting from this day, companies will need to document:

* The purposes for storing and processing personal data,

* The legal basis for doing so, and

* The sources where personal data was collected from.

Once you’ve outlined your privacy policy, you can configure your SuperOffice CRM solution to support these privacy rules.
