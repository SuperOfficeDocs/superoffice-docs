### The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has finally come into force, triggering significant changes to the way businesses process and protect personal data of their customers.

Companies that work with EU citizens’ data by now should have been ready to meet the main GDPR requirements, or, at least, have a solid plan of how to become GDPR compliant.

Yet, there are still a lot of companies that struggle to get the hang of what the GDPR means, how it affects their business and how to make it all work. So, it’s not surprising that it will take a while before we all return to “business as usual”.

## The long road to GDPR compliance

Since SuperOffice has always taken protection of individual data very seriously, we started our GDPR preparations quite early.

That’s why, for more than a year, we have been offering you a lot of information on how to understand and prepare for the arrival of the GDPR – articles, blogs posts, videos, whitepapers, check lists, webinars, etc.

As a company, we started getting ready for the GDPR two years ago already. All this time we researched and explored how the new EU regulation affected our business. Then, we began to upgrade our product and share our GDPR knowledge with our customers. And it seems like we did it quite well, as SuperOffice now offers a fully [GDPR compliant product](https://www.superoffice.com/globalassets/home-trust-centre/gdpr-and-crm/dla-piper---gdpr-compliance-superoffice-crm_en.pdf)!

Yet, we also realized that it may be still difficult, and at times overwhelming, to comprehend the many different pieces of information that we’ve offered during all this time, as the GDPR is a serious change.
