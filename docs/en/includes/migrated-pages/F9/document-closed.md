# What to do when I get “Document Closed” in the side panel of SuperOffice CRM when Document Viewer is used?

Every time I switch from viewing a document to another record in SuperOffice CRM (Contact, Projects, etc.), I get a message Document Closed. Why does it happen and what I can do about it?

This is the intended behavior of the Document Viewer application.

A document preview must be closed every time you click away from the document to optimize the use of the system resources. In other words, to prevent long loading times the document must be closed. Please read [this article](https://infobridgekb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDV/pages/35258371/message+DOCUMENT+CLOSED+-+To+keep+you+focussed..........+is+popping+up) for more information.

If you want to see the document again, please come back to the document tab and select the document record again.

If you want to see any other view in the side panel, click on the arrow and choose another view.
