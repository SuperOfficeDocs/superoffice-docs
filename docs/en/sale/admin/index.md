# Managing sale types, stages, and guides

SuperOffice CRM provides administrators with tools to standardize sales workflows through **sale types**, **stages**, and **guides**. These features ensure consistent sales tracking, task management, and document handling across your team.

Use the **Workflow** and **Lists** screens in **Settings and maintenance** to configure and manage these components.

## Key concepts and locations

| Term | Definition | Location in Settings and maintenance |
|---|---|---|
| Sale type | Categorizes sales (for example, "New Customer" or "Renewal") and links them to stages and guides. | **Lists** > **Sale - Type, Stages, Quote** |
| Sale stage | Tracks the phase of a sale (for example, "Quotation" or "Contract Signing"). Defined per sale type. | **Lists** > **Sale - Stage** |
| Sales guide | A workflow tool linking stages to specific follow-ups and documents. | **Workflow** > **Sales guide** |
| Currency | A list item defining available currencies for sales amounts, including exchange rate and unit. | **Lists** > **General – Currency** |
| Base currency | The primary currency used for system-wide calculations and exchange rates. | **Preferences** > **Global preferences** > **System** > **Base currency** |

## Customize your sales lists

SuperOffice CRM is designed to support the sales types common for most businesses, yet there are still some companies that may want to create their own.

Depending on the type of business your company is in, you can tailor the system by creating the sales lists you need.

Have a look at the following lists, to see whether you want to change them or not:

* Sale - Source
* Sale - Stage
* Sale - Type Category
* Sale - Type, Stages, Quote

## What do you want to do?

* [Add a sale stage][3]: Define and manage sales phases such as "First Meeting" or "Closing."
* [Add a sale type][4]: Create categories such as "Prospect" and assign relevant stages.
* [Create a new sales guide][1]: Design workflows with follow-ups and documents for sale types.
* [Edit or deactivate a sales guide][2]: Update workflows or disable guides for specific sale types.
* [Manage currencies][5]: Add currencies or change the base currency used in sales.

These tools empower administrators to tailor sales workflows, ensuring efficiency and consistency across teams.
