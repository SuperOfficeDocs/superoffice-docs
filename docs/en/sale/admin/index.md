# Managing sale types, stages, and guides

SuperOffice CRM provides administrators with tools to standardize sales workflows through **sale types**, **stages**, and **guides**. These features ensure consistent sales tracking, task management, and document handling across your team.

Use the **Workflow** and **Lists** screens in **Settings and maintenance** to configure and manage these components.

## Key concepts and locations

| Term | Definition | Location in Settings and maintenance |
|---|---|---|
| Sale type | Categorizes sales (for example, "New Customer" or "Renewal") and links them to stages and guides. | **Lists** > **Sale - Type, Stages, Quote** |
| Sale stage | Tracks the phase of a sale (for example, "Quotation" or "Contract Signing"). Defined per sale type. | **Lists** > **Sale - Stage** |
| Sales guide | A workflow tool linking stages to specific follow-ups and documents. | **Workflow** > **Sales guide** |

## What do you want to do?

* [Add a sale stage][3]: Define and manage sales phases such as "First Meeting" or "Closing."
* [Add a sale type][4]: Create categories such as "Prospect" and assign relevant stages.
* [Create a new sales guide][1]: Design workflows with follow-ups and documents for sale types.
* [Edit or deactivate a sales guide][2]: Update workflows or disable guides for specific sale types.

These tools empower administrators to tailor sales workflows, ensuring efficiency and consistency across teams.
