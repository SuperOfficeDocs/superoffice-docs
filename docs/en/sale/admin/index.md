# Managing sale types, stages, and guides

SuperOffice CRM provides administrators with tools to standardize sales workflows through **sale types**, **stages**, and **guides**. These features ensure consistent sales tracking, task management, and document handling across your team.

Use the **Workflow** and **Lists** screens in **Settings and maintenance** to configure and manage these components.

## Key concepts and locations

| Term | Definition | Location in Settings and maintenance |
|---|---|---|
| Sale type | Categorizes sales (for example, "New Customer" or "Renewal") and links them to stages and guides. | **Lists** > **Sale - Type, Stages, Quote** |
| Sale stage | Tracks the phase of a sale (for example, "Quotation" or "Contract Signing"). Defined per sale type. | **Lists** > **Sale - Stage** |
| Sales guide | A workflow tool linking stages to specific follow-ups and documents. | **Workflow** > **Sales guide** |
| Currency | A list item defining available currencies for sales amounts, including exchange rate and unit. | **Lists** > **General â€“ Currency** |
| Base currency | The primary currency used for system-wide calculations and exchange rates. | **Preferences** > **Global preferences** > **System** > **Base currency** |

## Customize your sales lists

SuperOffice CRM is designed to support the sales types common for most businesses, yet there are still some companies that may want to create their own.

Depending on the type of business your company is in, you can tailor the system by creating the sales lists you need.

Have a look at the following lists, to see whether you want to change them or not:

* Sale - Source
* Sale - Stage
* Sale - Type Category
* Sale - Type, Stages, Quote

Watch this video to see how you can edit your sales lists to make them fit the way you work. The example used in this video is of the Company - Category list which has similar setup as Sale - Stage (video length - 2:05):
