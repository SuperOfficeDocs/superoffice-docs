# Sale stage

[!include[Must be admin](../../learn/includes/req-admin.md)]

The **Stage** field in the Sale card tracks the phase of a sale, such as "Open," "Sold," or "Lost." These stages are predefined in the **Sale - Stage** list, which you can manage in **Settings and maintenance** under **Lists**.

Stages can be linked to [sale types][1], specifying which stages are available for each type. If no sales guide is defined, the **Stage** field is still visible on the sale, allowing users to view and update the sale's current stage.

## Add a sale stage

1. Select <i class="ph ph-list-bullets" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Lists** in the Navigator.

1. Select **Sale - Stage** from the dropdown menu. The **Items** tab displays all existing stages.

1. Click **Add** to open the **Edit list item** dialog.

1. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the new stage. *(Mandatory)*

    This name will appear in the **Stage** field on the Sale screen.

1. In the **Probability** field, specify the likelihood of a successful sale at this stage, as a percentage.

    This figure will appear next to the stage in the Sale screen.

1. *(Optional)* Add a description in the **Description** field to clarify the purpose of the stage.

1. Click **Save** to apply your changes or **Cancel** to discard them.

## Edit or delete a sale stage

1. Follow steps 1â€“2 in **Add a sale stage** to access the **Sale - Stage** list.

1. To edit:
   1. Double-click the required stage to open the **Edit list item** dialog.
   1. Update the fields as needed and click **Save**.

1. To delete:
   1. Select the stage in the list and click **Delete**.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Deleting a stage removes it from all linked sale types and sales guides. Ensure it is not in active use before proceeding.

## Restore a deleted sale stage

If a sale stage has been deleted, you can restore it from the **Sale - Stage** list. However, restoring does not automatically reestablish any links between the restored item and related sale types or guides. You must recreate these connections manually if needed.

The steps are similar to [restoring a deleted sale type][2].
