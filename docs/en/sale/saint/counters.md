# SAINT counters

SAINT counters are updated automatically as you do things.

* When SAINT is enabled, whenever a contact or a project is created, a bunch of counter rows are created.
* Whenever an appointment, document, or sale is created, then the corresponding counter rows are updated.

## Example

When a sale is created, it is saved with sale status = 1 (open)

This updates the `CounterValue` for the `contact_id` in the sale with `saleStatus` = 1 and `saleStatus` = 4 (all).

Sales are grouped into amount classes, depending on the value (in the base currency) of the sale.

Assume the sale falls into amount-class 2.

We would then have to update the four counter values that correspond to this query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countervalue WHERE project_id = 56 AND sale_status in (1,4) AND amountclassid in (2,0)
```

| CounterValue_id | contact_id | person_id | project_id | sale_status | amountClassId | ... |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 40265 | 0 | 0 | 56 | 1 | 2 | |
| 40268 | 0 | 0 | 56 | 1 | 0 | |
| 40280 | 0 | 0 | 56 | 4 | 2 | |
| 40283 | 0 | 0 | 56 | 4 | 0 | |

 The counter values themselves are stored in:

* totalReg
* totalRegInPeriod
* notCompleted
* notCompletedInPeriod
* ...

Here is a larger extraction for the same project, but now also with `sale_status` 2 (sold) and `amountclass` 1 (small)

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countervalue where project_id =47 and sale_status in (1,2,4) and amountclassid in (2,1,0)
```
