# Searches on SAINT values

When SAINT is enabled, whenever a contact or a project is created, a bunch of [counter rows][2] are created.

Whenever an appointment, document, or sale is created, then the corresponding counter rows are updated.

Each [counterValue][1] row points to the `contact_id` or `project_id` it is linked to.  The counter values themselves are stored in the `totalReg`, `totalRegInPeriod`, `notCompleted`, `notCompletedInPeriod`, and so on fields.

Here are some of the counter values for a project:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM countervalue where project_id =47 and sale_status in (1,2,4) and amountclassid in (2,1,0)
```

| sale_status | amountClassId | totalReg | totalRegInPeriod | notCompleted | lastRegistered | ... |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 8 | 0 | 8 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 1 | 0 | 11 | 1 | 11 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 2 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 6 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 2 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 9 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 4 | 1 | 14 | 0 | 14 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2021-11-05 |  |
| 5 | 0 | 21 | 1 | 21 | 2021-11-05 |  |

If we want to search on the SAINT counters, we would use the counter-value fields as criteria and read out the `project_id` or `contact_id`.

If we wanted to find all projects where there is an open sale, in any size, and no sale has been registered in the past year:

```SQL
SELECT project_id FROM CounterValue WHERE project_id > 0 AND sale_Status = 1  AND amountClassId=0 AND lastRegistered < '2005.10.1'
```

If we only wanted to search for small sales, we would use the amount-class "small" (`amountclass_id=1`)

```SQL
SELECT project_id FROM CounterValue WHERE project_id > 0 AND sale_Status = 1  AND amountClassId=1 AND lastRegistered < '2005.10.1'
```

If we want to find all contacts with no sales registered in the period, we would search like this:

```SQL
SELECT contact_id, project_id FROM CounterValue WHERE contact_id > 0 AND sale_Status = 4  AND amountClassId=0 AND totalRegInPeriod =0
```

* Sale-status = 4  (All sales)
* amount-class = 0 (all sizes)

If we want to find all contacts with more than 5 sales registered (since the beginning of time):

```SQL
SELECT contact_id, project_id FROM CounterValue WHERE contact_id > 0 AND sale_Status = 4  AND amountClassId = 0 AND totalReg > 5
```

If we want to find all contacts with more than 4 phone-call appointments (`record_type=5` on task) registered in this period:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM CounterValue WHERE contact_id > 0 AND record_type = 5  AND direction > 0  AND intent_id = 0 AND totalReg > 4
```

> [!NOTE]
> We must specify `intent_id` for appointments/documents to avoid duplicate IDs in the result. intent = 0 implies all intents.
