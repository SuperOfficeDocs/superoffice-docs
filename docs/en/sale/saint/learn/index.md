# Status monitors

[!include[Requirement](includes/req-saint.md)]

If you have purchased a licence for SAINT ("SAles INTelligence"), you can specify criteria for status monitors of companies, contacts and projects in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. Statuses generated from these criteria can be visualized as an image shown in the company cards, contact cards or project cards. For example, you can display an image of a warning triangle for a customer who has required a lot of sales meetings but who has not generated any sales, or a spider's web for a customer who has not been contacted in more than three months. This provides you with a clear and instant indication of particular statuses, which may be very useful to sales staff.

When you see a status image for a company, contact or a project, you have two options:

* If you hold the mouse pointer over the image, a tooltip appears showing you the same of the status and a description. You also get information about any other statuses relating to the company, contact or project.
* If you click the image, the [View statuses dialog][1] is displayed, and here you can see the name and description of the status and carry out relevant tasks for the company, contact or project.

> [!TIP]
> You can combine one or more of these statuses as criteria when you create a dynamic selection and, in this way, get a simple overview of companies, contacts or projects whose statuses meet these criteria.
