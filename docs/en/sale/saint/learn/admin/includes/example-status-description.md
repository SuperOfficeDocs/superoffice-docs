A status could, for example, apply to companies that fulfil the following criteria:

* Category = Customer
* Last sale more than 2 months old
* Number of sales greater than 50

The text in the **Description** field could then be:

"&lt;name&gt; has previously been a good customer, but we have not sold anything to them in 2 months. &lt;cont&gt; is the main contact for this customer and should get in touch with the customer soon by phone (&lt;cpho&gt;) or email (&lt;mail&gt;) to find out why."

In this example, the following template variables are used to tailor the text to the company in question:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| &lt;name&gt; | the name of the company is inserted here |
| &lt;cont&gt; | the name of our contact for the company is inserted |
| &lt;cpho&gt; | the company's phone number |
| &lt;mail&gt; | the company's email address |
