# Monitor your pipeline and forecast sales

To reach your long-term sales goals, it is essential to maintain a healthy pipeline. It will help you have an objective overview of both the individual and the group pipeline, allowing you to react quicker, fill the gaps and identify the deals that require additional resources or efforts.

## Use dashboards to manage your sales pipeline

The [SuperOffice Dashboard][2] gives you quick access to the tiles, such as charts, reports, and statistics, that are important to you.

When you [create a dashboard][1], you can choose from a wide range of predefined tiles. Click on a chart tile to drill down on the chart data.

### Examples

The **My forecast** tiles will help you stay on track by showing you your closed sales and your open sales for last month, this month and the month ahead.

The different **Big number** tiles will give you an overview of your pipeline with actual sales numbers and sales values. So, you will always know the exact value of what you are working on.

The **Largest upcoming sales** tile will let you see all your sales in order of their value, helping you to prioritize your time accordingly.

The **My activity pace** tile will let you see your activities sorted by type. The data will help you identify if you are spending too much or too little time on certain activities.

The **Sales YTD compared to last year for my group tile** is a great way to keep an eye on if your teams' sales are growing.

## Use selections to forecast sales

The [Find feature][5] in SuperOffice CRM lets you search and find different types of data. This means that you can also use Find to forecast your sales. By using the Find feature you can filter out the data of any field in your SuperOffice CRM.

Examples:

* I want a list of all sales over €5,000 due to be completed next month.
* I want a list of all my stalled sales.
* I want a list of all sales proposals sent this month.
* I want a list of customers who have purchased a product that we are planning to upgrade.

To get you going, the Find screen contains some ready-made search templates, called **typical searches**. These searches include overviews showing your sales opportunities and activities for the current month, as well as for the months ahead. There is also a selection of all sales that have been forgotten. Click the **Find** button to start.

### Example

To demonstrate how you can use the Find feature for sales forecasting, here is an example of how to create a search for all open sales, made this year, that are larger than €5000:

1. Click on Find Sale to open a new search related to sales.

    ![Click on the Find Sale to open a new sales related search -screenshot][img8]

2. Here you can modify the predefined fields with new input, or delete unnecessary criteria altogether, or click Add button to add a new search criterion.

3. When you click Add, a drop-down menu will appear. Click on Sale in the drop-down menu. Then select the field called Amount.

4. Click on the second field that currently shows you the = sign. Choose the sign >.

5. Add the value that has to be met. In this case, greater than €5000. Click on the third field and add 5000.

6. To add more criteria just repeat this process.

7. Press Find at the bottom of the screen to see all your open sales opportunities with a value larger than €5000.

you have now created a list containing all open sales worth over €5000 made this year. You can use this list as it is, or you can use this list to present your finding in a different way. You can, for example, [visualize your list with a graph][6], and add it to your [personal sales dashboard][7].
