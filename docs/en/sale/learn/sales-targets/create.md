# Set up sales targets

Keep track of your budgets by setting up sales targets. This will help you to set the right expectations, plan your growth, increase motivation and save time.

![The Targets dialog gives you an overview of your current and previous sales targets -screenshot][img5]

The target list can contain of the following sections:

* The company's target
* The user group's target
* The user's target
* The sum of targets for all users in one user group (not editable)

It is optional to add the company target and to have user specific targets (go to Target settings to change). The sum of all targets in one user group is not editable. It shows the sum for all the users in one user group and is a guideline to make it easier to set up the target for the whole user group. You can add and edit the company target, because the target for the whole company is not necessarily the same as the sum of all user groups.

## Add targets for a year

> [!TIP]
> The default target type is **All sales - Amount**. If you have the Sales Targets Unlimited licence, you can create additional target types.

1. Click ![icon][img1] **Main menu** and select **Targets**. If no sales targets have been created yet, the list is empty.

2. In the **Sales targets** screen, select the year that you want to create a sales target for from the **Select year** list. Your can also set up targets for previous years, to create budget statistics back in time.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have selected a year AND the previous year contains sales targets, you will be asked if you want to create targets based on the previous year. You can copy the targets as is, or select to increase the targets by a given percentage.

3. Click **Add groups and users**. Use the search field to find specific groups.

4. Click the relevant group in the list. If you want to add a target for the whole company, select **Company target**. The selected group is added to the overview with monthly/quarterly targets set to 0 in the default currency (unless you have copied the numbers from another year). All users (primary group members) belonging to a group are listed below the group.

5. Use the expand/collapse buttons at the top or the arrows next to each group to show or hide users.

6. If applicable, change the currency for the company or group. The default currency is the base currency set for you company. You cannot set currency for individual users.

7. Adjust the numbers manually using the **TAB** key go the next field. You can also [copy and paste numbers from Excel](#import) or click the menu button ![icon][img2] at the end of a row and select **Adjust numbers**. Options:

    * **Set initial amount**: Enter the amount for the whole year. The amount is split equally among the months or quarters on the current row.
    * **Copy from**: Copy the values from another group or user.
    * **Copy from last year**: Copy values from last year and increase the values by a specific percentage. This option is disabled if last year has no values.
        Click **Save** when you are done. The sums for all users are added to the **All** row at the top of the list of users.

8. Optional: When you have completed a row, you can lock it ![icon][img3]-![icon][img4] to disable editing. For example, after a budget is approved and should not be edited. Locked rows cannot be removed, cleared or edited.

9. If a specific group or user should not have a sales target, click the menu button ![icon][img2] and select **Clear** to empty the values.

10. Click **Save**.

11. Repeat steps 3-10 to add additional groups or companies. This requires the Sales Targets Unlimited licence.

12. Go to step 2 to add sales targets for another year, or click **Save and close** to exit this screen.

> [!NOTE]
> To remove a company or group target, click the menu button ![icon][img2] and select **Remove company target** or **Remove group target**.

## Lock/unlock function

Depending on your user role (the "Can lock/unlock targets" functional right), you can lock and unlock a sales target. When the sales target is approved, you can select the row to lock it, and then the row will be disabled for editing. If the sales target was approved and locked, it should not be unlocked unless there are certain reasons to modify it.

## Copy numbers from another user's target

To avoid having to set up the sales targets from scratch again for a different user, you can copy another user's sales target as they are (fixed numbers), adjust the target up or down with % or set the initial annual amount.

If you have added some numbers that are not correct, or a user has quit the company, you can select to clear the numbers added. Notice that you cannot delete a user in a user group if the user does not have any sales targets, but you can clear the row.
