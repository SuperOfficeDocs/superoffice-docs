    > [!NOTE]
    > Some sale types are linked to a [sales guide][1]. If you switch sale type, the associated sales guide also disappears. Any follow-ups and documents created in connection with the sales guide will remain on the **Activities** section tab in the diary. If you later switch back to the original sale type, the link between the follow-ups/documents and the sales guide is restored.

10. In the **Stage** field, enter the sale's current stage:

    * If the sale type for the sale does not have any stages linked to it, the sale has the status **Open**. If you click the arrow, you can set the sale to **Sold** and **Lost**. The fields below then change so you can enter the date, competitor and reason for the [sold/lost sale][2].
