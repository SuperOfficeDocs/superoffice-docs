Set up sales targets to keep track of your budgets. Sales targets can be set up per year for your organization, groups/teams and users, with monthly or quarterly intervals. In the dashboard you can add custom tiles to view budgets and actual sales in the same diagram.

## Before you start

Before you start using the sales targets feature, you must set up a few things in SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance:

* By default the sales targets are divided into months, but you can change this to quarterly targets. In SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance, go to **Preferences** > **Global system preferences** > **Targets** to make any changes.

* Locking and unlocking sales targets are only available to users with the functional right called **Can lock and unlock targets**. This can be changed in **Roles** in SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance.

* Creating, editing and deleting sales targets requires specific data rights. This can be changed in **Roles** in SuperOffice Settings and Maintenance.
