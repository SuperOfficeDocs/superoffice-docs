# Edit or remove stakeholders

You can update the **sales role** and **comment** fields for stakeholders, or remove stakeholders entirely.

## Update stakeholder information

1. Open the sale (see [Use the Find screen][1]) and go to the **Stakeholders** section tab.

1. Select one or more stakeholders from the list and click **Edit** at the bottom of the section tab. This will open the **Add/edit stakeholder** dialog.

1. In the **Add/edit stakeholder** dialog, select the stakeholders you want to edit.

1. Make changes:

    * Update the **Sales role** for the selected stakeholders.

    * Edit the **Comments** field to add or change additional details.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can select multiple stakeholders (hold Ctrl or Shift). Any changes made in the **Sales role** or **Comments** fields will apply to all selected stakeholders.

1. Click **OK** to save your changes or **Cancel** to discard them.

## Remove stakeholder

1. Select the stakeholders you want to remove from the list in the **Stakeholders** tab.

1. Click **Remove**. In the confirmation dialog that appears, click **Yes** to confirm.
