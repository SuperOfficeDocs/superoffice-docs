# Add stakeholders

> [!NOTE]
> You can also [add stakeholders via the section tabs][2] containing contacts in the Company and Selection screens.

## Link the sale to stakeholders

1. Go to the required sale in the Sale screen. (See [Use the Find screen][1].)

2. Select the **Stakeholders** section tab.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this section tab is not displayed, it must be specified in Settings and maintenance that this sales type has stakeholders.

3. Click the **Add** button below the section tab. The **Add stakeholders** dialog opens.

4. The active sale is displayed by default in the **Sale** field. You can select a different sale to add the stakeholders to, if you want. You do this by clicking the arrow and selecting the required sale in the list box that appears, or by simply entering the name of the sale.

5. In the **Company/contact** field:

    * To select a contact from a company: Click the arrow and select the company you want in the list that appears, or type the name of the company. By default the company that is active in the Company screen is shown.
    * To select a contact directly: Type the name of the contact (this applies to both contacts with and without an associated company), and click the name in the results list.

6. To add the company as a stakeholder, click the upper arrow button (to the right of the company). The company appears on the rightmost side of the window.

7. To add contacts as stakeholders, select the contact(s) and click the lower ![icon][img2] arrow button. The contact(s) will then be displayed on the right of the dialog.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the required name is not in the list, you must first [create the contact][3].

8. In the **Sales role** field, specify the role each of the companies and/or contacts has in the sale. Select the company and/or contact and click the arrow. This brings up a list of predefined alternatives to choose from. [!include[SM](../../../learn/includes/are-defined-sm.md)]
    A company/contact can be added as a stakeholder multiple times if different roles are specified in each case.

9. In the large text box under **Comments**, enter a more detailed description of the company's or contact's function within the sale, if required.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enter anything in this text box, a ![icon][img1] paperclip symbol is displayed to the right of the **Sales role** column in the **Stakeholders** section tab. Position the mouse pointer over the paperclip to display a tooltip containing the comment.

10. Repeat steps 4-9 for each stakeholder you want to add.

11. After entering the required information, click **Save**.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can select multiple companies and/or contacts on the right side of the window by holding down **CTRL** or **SHIFT** as you select. Changes you then make in the **Sales role** field and **Comments** text box will apply to all the selected companies/contacts.
