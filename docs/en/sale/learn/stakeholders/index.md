# Stakeholders

![icon][img1]

A sale has a main contact, but partners and subcontractors may also be involved in the sale. These are referred to as stakeholders and can be entered in the **Stakeholders** section tab at the bottom of the Sale screen. Stakeholders can include individuals as well as organizations.

For each stakeholder, information about company, contact name, role in the sale, email address and telephone number is displayed.
