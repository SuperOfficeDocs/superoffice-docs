# Record a sale

In the **Sale** screen you can enter information about sales on several levels, represented by the **Sale**, **Details**, **Links**, and **Note** tabs.

To edit an existing sale, browse to the sale and click **Edit** at the bottom of the **Sale** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> When you browse through sales using the arrow keys (or similar) and when you search for sales using FastSearcher, by default all sales are displayed. If you do not want to show completed sales (sold or lost), click ![icon][img1] **Task** and select **Skip completed sales**.

## Create the sale

1. Click **New** on the top bar and select **Sale**.

2. In the sale card, type in the name of the sale in the field with a red underline. This field is mandatory.

    </details>

4. Optionally, go to the **Details**, **Links**, or **Note** tab to [enter further information about the sale][1].

5. After entering the required information in all the tabs, click **Save**. You have now created a sale card for the new sale.
