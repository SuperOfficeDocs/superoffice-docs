The **Sale** screen contains information about the sales entered into SuperOffice CRM. Each sale is displayed like an index card, showing all information about that sale.

To move between sales, click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img4] ) at the bottom right of the cards.

You can also [create a quote][1] in the **Quote** section tab in the Sale screen.

## Where can I view sales?

In addition to the [Sale screen][2], sales are displayed on the [Sales section tab][13] in the Company, Contact, Diary, and Project screens

> [!TIP]
> Double-click a sale in one of these locations to open the sale in the Sale screen.

## Use sales overview to prioritize

Keep your sales organized so that you are always focused on the sales that matter the most to you.

After you have registered all your sales in SuperOffice CRM, they will appear in your personal sales overview in the **Sales** tab and in your Diary.

You can organize your sales list by [filtering, grouping and adding the columns][3] that are most important for you. The most used columns are: sales amount, sales date and sales stage.

The **Sales** tab also acts like a sales secretary by highlighting all your upcoming planned activities in the **Next Activity** field, as well as drawing your attention to those that you may have forgotten in red font.
