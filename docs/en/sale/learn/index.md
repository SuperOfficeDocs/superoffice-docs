## Where can I view sales?

In addition to the [Sale screen][2], sales can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

* On the **Sales** section tab in the Company screen
* On the **Sales** section tab in the Contact screen
* On the **Sales** section tab in the Diary screen
* On the **Sales** section tab in the Project screen

> [!TIP]
> Double-click a sale in one of these locations to open the sale in the Sale screen.

## Use sales overview to prioritize

Keep your sales organized so that you are always focused on the sales that matter the most to you.

After you have registered all your sales in SuperOffice CRM, they will appear in your personal sales overview in the **Sales** tab and in your Diary.

You can organize your sales list by [filtering, grouping and adding the columns][3] that are most important for you. The most used columns are: sales amount, sales date and sales stage.

The **Sales** tab also acts like [a sales secretary][8] by highlighting all your upcoming planned activities in the **Next Activity** field, as well as drawing your attention to those that you may have forgotten in red font.
