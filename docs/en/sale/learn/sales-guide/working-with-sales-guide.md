# Work with sales guides

## Behavior when a sale has a guide

* The first stage in the sales guide is selected in the **Stage** field on the main **Sale** card.

* Follow-ups and/or documents for the stage are listed on the **Sales guide** section tab.

## The sales process

1. Click the **Create** button in front of the follow-up/document name.

2. In the dialog which appears, you create the follow-up/document in the usual way. Many of the fields are prefilled, but you can change the information, or add more information. See [The Document dialog][1] and [The dialog for follow-ups][2].

3. When you have completed the follow-up, check **Completed** in the relevant dialog, or in the checkbox in front of the follow-up name on the **Sales guide** section tab. By default, documents are marked as completed.

    > [!TIP]
    > To create several follow-ups of the same type, right-click the activity and select **Create another**. The [follow-ups dialog][2] then opens.

4. Once all follow-ups and documents for a stage are completed, go to the next stage on the main **Sale** card.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you wish, you can go to the next stage without creating or performing all the follow-ups/documents in a stage.

5. Repeat the above procedure for all follow-ups/documents in each stage of the sales guide.

## How to advance the status

You can move the project to the next status in two ways:

**From the Sales guide:**

1. Right-click the button for the next status in the **Sales guide** section tab and select **Move to this status**.

**From the Sale tab:**

1. Click **Edit** on the **Sale** tab.
2. Click the arrow next to the **Stage** field.
3. Select the required stage from the list that appears. Apart from the statuses **Sold** and **Lost**, the options in the list are defined in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.
4. Click **Save**.

## Why does the Sales guide dialog open when I mark a follow-up as completed?

In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, it is possible to specify that a follow-up in a sales guide should be suggested automatically when the preceding follow-up is marked as completed. In that case, the **Sales guide** dialog opens when you mark the previous follow-up as completed.

In the **Sales guide** dialog you have three options:

* Click **Create** to create the next follow-up in the sales guide. This takes you directly to the dialog for follow-ups.

* Click **Cancel** if you do not want to create the follow-up at the moment. The **Sales guide** dialog closes and you should remember to create the follow-up later on.

* Check **Always create follow-up? Do not show this dialog again** if, in future, you always want to create the suggested follow-up. The dialog for follow-ups will then open automatically next time.

> [!TIP]
> To reset this option, so that the **Sales guide** dialog opens, go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Sale** and select **Yes** for the **Confirm creation of suggested follow-up** option.

## Example

Keep in mind that your sales guides may be configured differently in Settings and maintenance.

### Enter a new sale and select a sale type

You record a new sale and select the **Sale to new customer** sale type, which is linked to a sales guide. The sales guide contains the following stages, follow-ups and documents:

| Stage | Follow-ups | Documents |
|---|---|---|
| First meeting | Customer meeting (Meeting (External)) | Meeting confirmation (Email) |
| Quotation | Quotation preparation (Task) | Quotation (Letter) |
| Signing of contract | Set up contract meeting (Phone-Out)<br /> Contract meeting (Meeting (External)) | Signed contract |

### The First meeting stage

1. You have agreed a meeting time and want to create the **Customer meeting** appointment in the Diary and invite participants.

    1. In the sales guide, you click **Create** next to the **Customer meeting** follow-up.
        The **Appointment** dialog opens, with **Meeting (External)** specified as the appointment type and the name of the sale and company prefilled.
    2. [Complete the information and invite participants][1].
    3. Click **Save**.

2. For the sake of good order, you want to send an email confirming the time and location of the meeting.

    1. Click **Create** next to **Meeting confirmation**.
        The **Document** dialog opens with **Email** already selected as the document type, and the name of the company and sale prefilled.
    2. Complete the rest of the information in the fields in the **Document** dialog.
    3. Click the **Create** button to create and send the email.

3. Once the meeting has taken place, you want to confirm this in the sales guide.

    In the sales guide, check the box next to the **Customer meeting** follow-up.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also do this from the activities list in, for example, the **Diary** and the **Company** screens.

### The Quotation stage

1. All of the follow-ups and documents in the **First meeting** stage are completed and you want to go to the next stage in the sales guide.

    1. Click the **Edit** button on the main **Sale** card.
    2. Click the arrow next to the **Stage** field and select **Quotation** from the list.
    3. Click **Save**.
        The follow-ups and documents for this new stage are now displayed in the **Sales guide** section tab.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also right-click the **Quotation** button on the **Sales guide** section tab and select **Move to this stage**.

2. You want to create a task in your diary to remind you that you need to prepare a quotation.

    1. Click **Create** next to the **Quotation preparation** follow-up.
        The **Task** dialog opens, with **Follow-up** specified as the task type.
    2. Complete the information.
    3. Click **Save**.
    4. After preparing the contents of the quotation, mark the activity as **Completed**.

3. You now want to create the quotation for the company.

    Click **Create** next to the **Quotation** document and [create the document][3].

### The Signing of contract stage

1. After all the follow-ups and documents you want to use in the **Quotation** stage are completed, go to the last stage in the sales guide, which is **Signing of contract**.

    1. Click the **Edit** button on the main **Sale** card.
    2. Click the arrow to the right of the **Stage** field and select **Signing of contract** from the list.
    3. Click **Save**.
        The follow-ups and documents for this stage are now displayed in the **Sales guide** section tab.

2. You want to create and perform the first follow-up in this stage.

    1. Click **Create** next to the **Set up contract meeting** phone call and create the phone call in the usual way.

    2. After completing the phone call, check the box.

    3. In the **Sales guide** dialog you have three options:

        * Click **Create** to create the **Contract meeting** appointment, which is the next follow-up in the sales guide. This takes you directly to the dialog for follow-ups.

        * Click **Cancel** if you do not want to create the follow-up at the moment. The **Sales guide** dialog closes and you should remember to create the follow-up later on.

        * Check **Always create follow-up? Do not show this dialog again** if, in future, you always want to create the suggested follow-up. The dialog for follow-ups will then open automatically next time.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Sales guide** dialog opens because **Automatically suggest this follow-up** is set for the **Contract meeting** follow-up in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. You can choose to not have this dialog appear, so that the next follow-up is suggested automatically.

3. You want to create the **Contract meeting** appointment from the **Sales guide** dialog.

    Click **Create** in the **Sales guide** dialog.
    The **Appointment** dialog opens, where you can create the meeting in the usual way.

4. Then you want to create the contract to take to the meeting.

    1. Click **Create** next to the **Signed contract** document to create the contract.
    2. After the contract meeting and the contract is signed, mark the **Contract meeting** appointment as completed.

You can now change the stage to **Sold**. After all the required follow-ups and documents for the sale are completed, you can set the sale status to completed.

> [!TIP]
> If you want the sale to remain visible in, for example, the **Activities** section tab in the **Sale** screen and the **Sales** section tab in the **Diary** screen, you must not set the sale to completed.
