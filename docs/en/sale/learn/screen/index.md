# The Sale screen

The **Sale** screen contains information about the sales entered into SuperOffice CRM. Each sale is displayed like an index card, showing all information about that sale.

To move between sales, click the previous/next buttons ( ![icon][img2] ![icon][img1] ) at the bottom right of the cards.

You can also [create a quote][1] in the **Quote** section tab in the **Sale** screen.

## The Details tab

This tab contains fields that focus, in particular, on the financial details of the sale.

## The Links tab

Here you can add links that are relevant for the sale you are working on, such as URL addresses, projects, other sales, follow-ups and documents. For example, if you are going to a meeting with a company you have previously communicated with, you can add links to documents you have already created for this company.

[!include[How to add links](../../../learn/includes/howto-add-links.md)]

### Open links

You can open links by clicking on them in the **Links** tab. URLs/websites open in a new window.

### Remove links

To remove a link, go to the **Links** tab, click **Edit**, click the delete button next to the link. The link is deleted from the tab.

## The Note tab
