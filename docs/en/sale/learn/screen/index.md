# The Sale screen section tabs

The lower part of the Sale screen consists of section tabs.

* [Activities][6]
* [Sales guide][3]
* [Stakeholders][5]
* [Quote][7] (requires a licence)

[Sales guides][3] are only shown for specific sales types (defined in Settings and maintenance). If you select a sale type for which a sales guide is defined, the **Sales guide** section tab is displayed.
