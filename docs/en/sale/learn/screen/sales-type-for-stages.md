# Sale - Type, Stages, Quote

The **Sale** tab in the Sale screen contains the **Sale type** field. This field has a predefined list of options which are set up in the **Lists** screen in Settings and maintenance.

## Stages

Each sale in SuperOffice CRM must have a sale type, and each sale type can contain several [sale stages][3]. You can also specify that specific sale types are to have a [sales guide][4], to guide sales staff through the different stages of a sale, with associated follow-ups and documents.

For each sale type, you can specify [stakeholders][1].

## Quote attachments, defaults and approval

If Quote functionality is active, you can also set various options for quotes created from sales of this sale type. This includes attachments to be added to a quote, default values for templates and validity and approval requirements.
