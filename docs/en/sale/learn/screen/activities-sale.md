# The Activities section tab

The **Activities** section tab shows all follow-ups, documents, and emails that are linked to the active sale. Double-click an activity in the section tab to view or edit it, as required.

## Columns in the Activities section tab

The following columns are displayed on the **Activities** section tab:

* ![icon][img2] : **Completed** status of an activity. A tick in the checkbox (![icon][img1]) means that the [activity is completed][1], while an empty box means that it is not completed.

* The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, one category for each of the different types. For example, a calendar icon indicates a meeting. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.

* The date of the activity.
* The type of activity.
* Any description of the activity.
* Any company and contact the activity is linked to.
* ID specifies which user owns the activity.
