# The Activities section tab

The **Activities** section tab shows all appointments, tasks, phone calls, documents, and emails that are linked to the active sale. Double-click an activity in the section tab to view or edit it, as required.

## Columns in the Activities section tab

The following columns are displayed on the **Activities** section tab:

* ![icon][img2] : **Completed** status of an activity. A tick in the checkbox (![icon][img1]) means that the [activity is completed][1], while an empty box means that it is not completed.

* The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, one category for each of the different types. For example, a telephone icon indicates a phone call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.

    <details><summary>See a list of the different icons</summary>

    [!include[Table showing icons for activities](../../../learn/includes/table-activity-icons.md)]
    </details>

* The date of the activity.
* The type of activity.
* Any description of the activity.
* Any company and contact the activity is linked to.
* ID specifies which user owns the activity.

## Show all follow-ups and documents

By default, the activities for the current sales stage are shown in the lower half, but you can choose to show all activities and documents for all stages by checking **Show all stages** at the lower right of the section tab. You can also show the follow-ups and documents for one of the stages by clicking the button with the name of the stage.

You can go to the next stage by selecting it in the **Stage** list on the main card.
