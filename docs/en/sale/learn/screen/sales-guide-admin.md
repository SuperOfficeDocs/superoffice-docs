# Sales guide

In the **Sales guide** tab in the **Workflow** screen in Settings and maintenance, you can design sales guides to guide sales staff through the sales process. A sales guide consists of stages containing follow-ups and documents to guide the sales person through the sale. Each sales guide is linked to a sale type, and the sales guide is enabled in the Sale when the user creates a new sale or changes the sale type of an existing sale, and selects a sale type that has a sales guide linked to it.

## Example

The sale type "Sale to new customer" might consist of three stages: "First meeting", "Quotation" and "Contract signing". The "First meeting" stage might, for example, include the "Customer meeting" follow-up and the "Meeting invitation" document (an email).
