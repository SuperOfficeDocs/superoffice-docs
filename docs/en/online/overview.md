# About CRM Online

## Overview

SuperOffice CRM Online is our cloud offering. It gives you the freedom to access your CRM data – and be available – anywhere, everywhere, and always. You can work from your office, from home, from a customer's office, or from a hotel. In the cloud, you are always upgraded to the latest version.

We take care of the hosting, back-ups, upgrades, security, and everything necessary to keep your solution available in the cloud. This gives you more time to focus on your business and less time to worry about IT operations. Your data is stored in our data center with world-class reliability and security.

## Technology platform

SuperOffice CRM Online is based on the standard core product SuperOffice CRM Web client. The user interface is similar to the one that comes out of the package when installing Sales & Marketing web and has minor features added, such as links to SOLO (standard for all users) and a web panel for support.

From version 8, we introduce our new software in the online marked first.

SuperOffice CRM Online is accessed through any [supported browser][2] and our [WebTools][3] may be installed on your computer to get your email and documents integrated with SuperOffice.

On the server-side, the system runs on Windows web servers with a Microsoft SQL database. Web servers are resilient; they are all set up in an active/passive cluster. Several servers handle other services, such as file storage and batch-task service.

### Sign-in services

SuperOffice CRM Online platform includes features to help you handle how you sign in to SuperOffice Online.
