# Administrate folders of reply templates

Under **Knowledge Base > Reply templates**, you can put the reply templates in a folder structure you create yourself, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create subfolders in all folders, and you can place the appropriate reply templates in each of these folders. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

[!include[How to create a folder](../../../learn/includes/howto-create-folder-kb.md)]

You are now ready to [add reply templates][1] to the new folder.

## Delete folders

Before you delete a reply template folder, you must remove all the entries in it. You do this in one of the following ways:

* You can [delete the reply templates][2].
* You can move a reply template to another folder by changing the content of the **Folder** field when you [edit a reply template][3].
