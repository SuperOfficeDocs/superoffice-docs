# Edit reply templates

Editing a reply template can mean one of two things:

* When using [reply templates in request handling][1], you are free to edit the content of the message before you send it to the customer.
* From **Knowledge Base**, you can edit the properties specified when creating the reply template, including amending the reply template text. This type of editing is described below.

**Steps:**

1. Select **Knowledge Base > Reply templates**.
2. Go to the folder where the reply template is located.
3. Click the reply template. This takes you to the **View reply templates** screen.
4. Click the **Edit reply template** button. This takes you to the **Reply template properties** screen.
5. Make the required changes to the [properties][2].
6. Click **OK**. The changes are saved.
