# Template variables (Service)

In the email message, you can use template variables to insert customer-specific information to give the message a more personal touch. In this way, you can customize the content for each individual customer.

In the tables below you can find all template variables for SuperOffice Service and SuperOffice Marketing.

When editing reply templates and mailings, you can insert template variables by typing the variable between two square brackets (\[\[ \]\] ). Example: **\[\[customer.name\]\]**. In the HTML editor, you can also select the most common variables from the **Template variable** menu.
