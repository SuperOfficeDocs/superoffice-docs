# Search for reply templates

If there are lots of reply templates in a folder, it may be difficult to find the one you want. In that case, doing a search may be a good idea.

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Reply templates**.
2. Click the **Search** button. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.
3. [Search in SuperOffice Service][1].
