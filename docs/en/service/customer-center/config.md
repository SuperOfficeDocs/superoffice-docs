# Customer center configuration

The templates in the customer care center are also built up using the [parser variables][1]. Simple changes can be done using the parser variables, but if you are to do more advanced changes, you should consider using CRMScript, which is far more powerful and can coexist with parser variables.

The Customer Center is built up of different [templates][2].

## Common parser variables

The following parser variables are common for all the templates:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| AuthProgramAll | The URL used for accessing this page, with the session key added |
| AuthProgramUnderscore | The path to customer.exe with the session key and any CGI variables starting with an underscore |
| AuthProgram | The same as `AuthProgramUnderscore`, except that it does not pay attention to CGI variables with an underscore |
| CustSessionKey | The session key |
| authenticated | True if the customer has been authenticated, false if not |
| chat | True if the chat module is available |
| faq | True if the FAQ module is available |
| WwwRoot | The subdirectory that Customer Service might be installed to. Normally this will just be "/", but if installed in a subdirectory you must pay attention to this when referencing for example the graphic files |
| GfxRoot | The virtual path to the graphic files |
| GfxPath | The virtual path to the language-dependent graphic files. This variable pays attention to the language of the customer |
| config.browser | The browser type used |
| GfxBase | The same as `GfxPath` but it might include the full URL if absolute URLs are used and configured |
| GfxUrl | The same as `GfxRoot` but it might include the full URL if absolute URLs are used and configured |
| Program | The URL to the customer.exe program. Use this if you use cookies for storing the session key of the customer |
| contentFile | The name of the template that will match the chosen action. See also **framework.html**. |

## addMessage.html

This is the template used when adding a message to an existing request. The following parser variables are available:

* Ticket
* Company
* Customer

In addition, the following parser variables are available:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| mailCc | The cc mail addresses when doing a post |
| message | The message when doing a post |
| attachments | The attachment ids when doing a post |

## changeCust.html

This is the template used when a customer changes their information. The following parser variables are available:

* Company
* Customer

In addition, the following parser variables are available:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| cellphone | The value in the `cellphone` field |
| phone | The value in the `phone` field |
| lastname | The value in the `lastname` field |
| firstname | The value in the `firstname` field |

## doneRegister.html

This is the template used to display a welcome message when a new customer has registered. The following parser variables are available:

* Company
* Customer

In addition, the following parser variables are available:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| custPassword | The password for the new customer. This might be in encrypted form if turned on |
| custUsername | The username for the new customer |

## framework.html

This is a special template. The framework.html is the framework that will surround all the other templates. In this way, you do not need to style all the other templates.

You can use the same parser variables in this file as with the other files. It is the chosen action that determines what is available here, so only use parser variables that you are certain will exist.

Pay attention to the parser command `%INCLUDE_VAR:contentFile%`. As explained earlier, each chosen action will result in a parser variable called **contentFile**. This parser variable will contain the name of the template matching the action. The command `INCLUDE_VAR` will simply insert this file into the *framework.html* file.

## listSimilarKbEntries.html

This template is used to list similar FAQ entries when using the wiki functionality of the FAQ.

The FAQ entry hits are placed in the following parser variables. This is an array, so you must use `%ROWSTART%` and `%ROWEND%` to loop over them.

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| kbEntry.url | The URL to the FAQ entry in HTML format (so no need to add the tag), with the correct name |

| Variable | Description |

## listTicket.html

* Message, but not that this will be an array, so you need to use `%ROWSTART%` and `%ROWEND%` to loop over them.
* Message where is the number of the message starting from 0. This makes each message accessible as a single parser object.
* Company
* Customer
* Ticket

| Variable | Description |

| orderBy | The ORDERBY clauses used, so you can preserve the order in other URLs. The value should be set in the URL to make the customer care center use the order for the request list. The field should be separated with a comma. Possible values: "status", "id", "title", "created", "category", "priority". At the end of the list, you should append the direction. |
