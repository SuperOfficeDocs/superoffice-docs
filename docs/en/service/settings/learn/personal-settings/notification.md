# Notification

In SuperOffice Service, request handlers can choose to receive notifications of various events. In the **Notification** tab in the **Edit users** screen, you can check how you want to receive such notifications:

* **Pop-up**: The notification button ( ![icon][img2] ) in the [top bar][1] will indicate that you have new notifications.
* **Email**: You will receive an email message when an event occurs.
* **SMS** (if the SMS module is installed): You will receive a text message when an event occurs.

You can receive notifications of the following events in SuperOffice Service.

* **Open requests, not read in the last \[number\] days**: Check here to be notified of open requests that have not been edited for the specified number of days and where you are the owner.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This option is activated from ![icon][img1] **System settings** > **System** > **Settings** > **Send email notification of open requests**.

* **New request**: Check here to be notified each time you are assigned a new request.

* **New message in request**: Check here to be notified each time a new message arrives for one of your requests.

* **Request escalated**: Check here to be notified when one of your requests is escalated (forwarded to another request handler under the [rules defined for escalation][2]).

* **Request activated**: Check here to be notified when one of your requests is activated (given the **Open** status again after having been **Postponed** or **Closed**).

* **When someone takes over your request**: Check here to be notified when one of your requests is taken over by another request handler.

* **For requests in your favorites list**: Check here to be notified about requests in your favorites list, in the same way as for your own requests.

* **Custom messages**: Check here to receive custom notifications created using scripts.
