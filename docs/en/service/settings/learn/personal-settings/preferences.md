# Preferences

In the **Preferences** tab in the **Edit users** screen, you can edit the following details for your own user profile:

* **Default status for new request**: Here you choose the default status to appear in the **Request** screen.

* **Default status for new message**: Here you choose the default status for a new message.

* **List only requests in own categories**: Checking here means that by default only requests in the categories you are a member of are displayed.

* **Automatically quote the last message**: If checked, the last message in the request is automatically pasted into a new message.

* **Only show open requests in my favorites list**: If checked, only open requests are shown in your favorites list. This is not recommended since, if you [transfer a request][1] to another request handler and this person closes the request, it disappears from your favorites list without you being notified.

* **Show only own categories**: If checked, you can select only categories you are a member of.

* **Use last category**: If checked, the default category in the **Request** screen is the same as last time.

* **Default category**: Check this option and select the default category when you register a request.

* **Language**: In this list box, you can select which language the SuperOffice Service interface should be in.

* **Spell check**: In this list box, you select which language to check spelling in (in messages for example).

* **Default owner**: In this list box you select who will be the default owner of requests you create. You have three options:

  * **Automatically assigned**: If you select this option, the system assigns the request in accordance with the applicable assignment rules.
  * **Unassigned**: You can also choose not to assign the request. The members of the relevant category then become responsible for dealing with the request. Such requests end up in the **Unassigned requests** lists under **Requests**.
  * **Yourself**: Selecting this option makes you the default owner of all requests you create.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can override this choice in the **Request** screen.
