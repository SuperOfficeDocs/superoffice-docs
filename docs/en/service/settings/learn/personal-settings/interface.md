# Interface

In the **Interface** tab in the **Edit users** screen, you can edit the following details for your own user profile:

* **Show the last message at the top**: Checking here causes the messages in a request to be sorted with the most recent at the top.

* **Preview image attachments in messages**: Checking here causes images attached to messages to be previewed in the **Request** screen.

* **No. of expanded messages**: Checking here allows you to specify, in the field next to the checkbox, the number of messages to be expanded in the **Request** screen.

* **New window when adding a message to a request**: Checking here causes a new browser window to be opened when the selected users click **Add message**.

* **Width of text area**: Here you specify (as number of characters) the width of the text box where messages are entered.

* **Height of text area**: Here you specify (as number of characters) the height of the text box where messages are entered.

* **Don't show warning when data might be lost**: Checking here causes a warning not to be shown if there is a risk of losing data you have entered, for example, when you are exiting a screen without having saved any changes first.

* **Use simplified text editor**: Checking here prevents the display of formatting options when writing a message, for instance.

* **Single line breaks in text editor**: If checked, the mouse pointer is moved to the next line when you press **ENTER** in the text editor. The default setting is for a double line break to be inserted.

* **Retain formatting when pasting text**: Checking here means that the original formatting of text you paste into messages is retained.

* **Show checkboxes to the left in lists**: If checked, checkboxes are displayed on the left of lists instead of on the right, in, for example, the **Result** section of the search screen. This does not apply to custom checkboxes.

* **Show messages as plain text**: If checked, the content of messages is shown as plain text. Images and formatting are not shown.
