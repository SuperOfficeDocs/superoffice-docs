# Edit the layout of a card

[!include[Requirement](../../../includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

When you have [created a new layout][6], it is time to customize it. Personalize the layout for the main cards and archives to match your organization's information needs.

## Considerations

Before customizing a layout, determine who the intended users are.

* What do they need at their fingertips?
* Do they need all default fields and tabs, or should you remove something?
* Do they require additional tabs?
* What is the logical order of fields?

> [!NOTE]
> You can edit the **default layout**, however, you cannot edit the default control settings and you cannot re-assign the layout to a user group.

Watch this video and find out how to use the screen designer to configure your screens in SuperOffice CRM or follow the step-by-step guide below (video length - 6:41):

## <a id="save"></a>Save, publish, or cancel

After editing a layout, click one of the following buttons:

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| Save draft | Saves an unpublished version of the layout, which you can resume editing later or ask someone to review. |
| Save + Publish | Applies the layout to the selected user groups **or** sale/project/request/follow-up type . |
| Cancel | Discards all changes. |

## <a id="undo-changes"></a>Undo changes

If you need to revert to an earlier version of the screen, you can access the following options from the **Task** button (<i class="ph ph-dots-three-circle-vertical" aria-hidden="true"></i>):

* **Reset to factory settings**: This option discards all changes and resets the layout to the default version provided by SuperOffice.

* **Restore tabs**: This option reinstates any tabs that have been previously removed.

* **Discard draft**: This option discards all unsaved changes and reverts the layout to the most recently published version.

## <a id="delete"></a>Delete layout

When a user-group-based layout is deleted, users in that group see the default (system) layout.

To delete a layout:

1. Select the layout in the **Layouts** list.
1. Click **Delete**.
