# ZIP compression on REST

Since SuperOffice 8.5 R01 we added support for ZIP compression on REST API.

This can be utilized by Pocket CRM client, which has now support for REST to be able to offer compression and thus higher speed in its contact with NetServer.

To be able to use IIS dynamic compression, you will need:

* Pocket client >= 9.0.4
* NetServer >= 8.5.7066 (8.5 R01)

Basic Authentication needs to be disabled on the IIS website. SuperOffice Web installer will do it for you since 8.1 R02.

These new features should work in both online and onsite, and onsite remote installations as long as the site is correctly configured, and minimum versions are met.
