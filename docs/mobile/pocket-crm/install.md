4. You must now set the URL in the app to connect it to the server by setting the *connection URL / connection string / URL to your Pocket server / NetServer installation*:

    ![x -screenshot][img5]

    Your administrator should know where to find this URL.

5. Sign in with the same username and password you use for the SuperOffice CRM and you are ready to use SuperOffice Pocket CRM!

## Reset the Pocket CRM client

If you need to either reset the settings or configure the client with another connection URL you can delete the settings by uninstalling the app then install it again - then you will be asked to choose how to connect (CRMOnline / Onsite) once more.
