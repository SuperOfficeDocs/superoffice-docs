A sale may have one or more stakeholders: a contact or person with an extra interest or role in the sale. This can be turned off using the preference in **SOAdmin - Preferences - Sale - Enable Stakeholders (default yes)**.

With this preference turned on a new archive is presented for sales of type.

This will also make the sale visible on more than one company salesarchive if **Enable Stakeholders** is set.

Use your favorite query tool and try this query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM saletype where hasStakeholders = 1
```

If there are sales defined with stakeholders, you may search the database for these sales:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM sale where saletype_id in (select saletype_id from saletype where hasStakeholders = 1)
```

For these sales we may look up the stakeholders, this will present the stakeholders for sale_id = 4

```SQL
SELECT * FROM salestakeholder where sale_id = 4
```
