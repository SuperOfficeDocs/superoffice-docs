# Securing HTTPS configuration on Windows Server

To apply the best practice HTTPS configuration on a Windows server, we can run a Powershell script written by NSM (Nasjonal Sikkerhetsmyndighet). This script will make changes to the Windows registry to enable the latest encryption algorithms and disable old and insecure algorithms and ciphers.

[Download the script from NSMs website][1]

1. Unzip the first ZIP file. Then inside the unpacked directory, unzip the second ZIP file *Schannel.zip* and enter the unpacked directory again. Holding shift and right-clicking gives us a menu where we can open a command window in the current directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The following must be done with administrator level-access.

2. Get a Powershell prompt by typing **powershell**. Then import the NSM Powershell module by entering the following commands:

```sh
Import-Module ‘.\\NSM TLS Tools.psm1’ –force
& ‘.\\Apply NSM Schannel Policy.ps1’
```

3. Follow the instructions and the script will check for compliance with recommended settings, backup existing settings to a registry file, change the settings to comply and run a final test.

To read more about the script, what it does and why, check out the PDF file in the unzipped directory called *U-03\_Sikring\_av\_Windows\_TLS.pdf*.
