If you do not want to **Allow unspecified CGI modules**Â it is also possible to use "Add..." to add each CGI file separately. This, however, requires you to make sure any new CGI files from Customer Service is added here.

6. Click **Add...**, navigate to the *\[Service installation\]\\www\\scripts* folder and add one by one all .exe files in this folder. For each write some description and tick **Allow extension path** to execute.
