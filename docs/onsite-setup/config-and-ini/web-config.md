# Web.config

Used by web, remote web services, service.

The *web.config* file is an XML file that can be changed as needed, but we recommend running the SuperOffice Web Configurator which is installed by the [web client][1]. Administrators can use configuration files to set policies that affect how applications run on their computers. Read more on [MSDN][2].

There are some SuperOffice specific sections, defined under the SuperOffice sectionGroup.

## Security

> [!WARNING]
> Do not change these values unless you are absolutely sure!

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Authentication | TrustedDomains(String) Check if a domain name is trusted.  Note -  separate section within the SuperOffice Security group section, it needs to be declared before it can be defined. |
| Cryptography | Cryptographic options, see table below. Note: change any of these keys at your own peril |
| Sentry | Ignore the Sentry mechanism, everything will be allowed (default 'False')<br>Relates to the Sentry system in SuperOffice. |

The sentry system can be thought of as the traffic cop, controlling access to the data in the database. Each object in NetServer has an associated sentry which is responsible for enforcing rules such as "private appointments are visible only to its owner". Sentry rules focus on ownership, group membership and user-level access.

### The *Cryptography* section is used for encrypting and decrypting user credentials

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| SymmetricKey | Base64 encoded key-string as documented by System.Security.Cryptography.RijndaelManaged. |
| SymmetricSecret | String value representing the user-defined secret, used when creating a hash (signature) to verify that the encrypted-decrypted value has not been tampered with. |

### ActiveDirectoryCredentialPlugin

> [!CAUTION]
> To find and import Active Directory users NetServer WebServices need to be in the Active Directory domain. This is why we recommend [scenario 2][3] with [reverse proxy][4] so you do not expose it to the DMZ.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Domain | ActiveDirectory domain to use when looking up users |
| Container | Container within the domain, use blank if you do not know |
| User | Domain user to log on to the domain  - needs to be able to list and view users |
| Password | Password of the domain user |

Single Sign-on (SSO) if you mean that the user should not be presented with the SuperOffice login dialog will not work when using the recommended installation scenario, but the user may still authenticate with his AD username and password. Also, note that using Remote web services for Web (where web and NetServer are on different servers) is not supported due to [Kerberos double-hop issues][5].

## Mail

Configuration of mail parameters when using the SuperOffice Inbox. This is also the one used by Pocket CRM.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reader | The Key used for mail reader - default MailKit from 8.1, used to be EasyMail |
| Sender | The Key used for mail sender - default MailKit from 8.1, used to be EasyMail |
| NumberOfDaysToDownload | Change how many days to past we should download and store emails. Defaults to 180 day |

SuperOffice Inbox downloads emails from your mailbox and stores them in the SuperOffice database.
If you want to change how many days to past we should download and store emails, you can add the following key `<add key="NumberOfDaysToDownload" value="XX" />` in Mail section:

```xml
<Mail>
  <Component>
    <add key="Reader" value="MailKit" />
    <add key="Sender" value="MailKit" />
    <add key="NumberOfDaysToDownload" value="30" />
  </Component>
</Mail>`
```

Now the Inbox will download emails younger than 30 days only. If no value is set, it defaults to 180 days.

## Factory

The Factory is part of a NetServer extension mechanism to support plug-ins. To utilize the methods you must develop your own method and configure it in a specific way in the configuration file to identify that you are enhancing a provided method.

## Diagnostics

Settings related to logging.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| EnableScaffolding | Boolean value determines whether to log verbose, detailed, information. Default off, only turn on for extended debugging and do turn this off later. |

| LogFailureAudit | Boolean value determines whether to log when an access failure occurs/failed authentications (default 'True') |
| LogFolder | Folder (for example UNC path) where the log file is to reside. Note that the owner of the process needs to have access to manipulate files in this folder |
| LoggedServices | List of services to be logged; default blank means all, otherwise a comma-separated list of service names (without the Agent suffix, for instance: BLOB, Appointment) |
| LogInformation | Log general information. This includes successful SQL's passed to the database. Only permit this option while debugging a bug. This will be a severe performance hit! (default 'False') |
| LogLongQueries | Should long-running queries be logged in textual form to a special file? default false |
| LogLongQueriesAsXML | Should long-running queries be logged to a special file (Query\_year.month.day.log) in XML serialized format, for later analysis and reruns using the QueryWorkbench tool |

| LogToTrace | Boolean value determines whether to log all Log-Levels to trace output. Log to a Trace that can be listened to by TraceListener. (default 'False') |
| LogWarning | Log warnings (default 'False') |
| LongQueryThreshold | Threshold for logging a long-running query, in milliseconds. Queries that execute in less than this time are not logged as long-running. The time is from the moment the SQL text is sent to the database until the first row (for a select) or the 'nn rows affected' return value is received. |

## Data / Database

### Data

The Data section group contains three sections, Database, Explicit and ImplicitAnonymous. Combined, these sections define which server and database the caller will connect as well as what state settings to use. Which state settings take effect are determined by how the caller decides to connect, Explicit or ImplicitAnonymous.

The *Session* section relates to the lifetime of a NetServer communication session, such as the duration of a transaction, or group of transactions, and maintains the credentials defined in one of the following sections.

| Parameter | Description |

**Modes:**

* Thread: Session is stored in a thread static manner.  Each executing thread has a separate instance of the session.  If the session is accessed on a different thread, it will contain a different value.  For further reference, see System.ThreadStaticAttribute.

* Process: Session is stored in a process static manner.  This is the normal option for windows applications.

* HttpContext: Recommended in ASP.NET applications. Added to prevent ASP.NET thread switches from changing identities in the middle of an ASP.net request.

* Context: Session is stored in a context static manner. For further reference, see System.ContextStaticAttribute.

* PartnerHttpContext: Helper class for SuperOffice.DevNet.Online.Login

You can add more alternative archive paths, like ArchivePath3, ArchivePath4,...
