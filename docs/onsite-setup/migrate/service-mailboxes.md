## How does this affect your company?

Simple! You will have to choose between have 2 alternatives:

* Keep the old email addresses and set up email forwarding to the new email address
* Use the new email addresses generated by SuperOffice

## If you want to keep your old email addresses?

Also! If you choose to use your old email addresses, you might need to add an [SPF Record][3].

**Why?**

**How?**

To add the SPF record, forward this information to your domain provider and refer to the following SPF (TXT) record:

```text
v=spf1 include:_spf.online.superoffice.com ~all
```
