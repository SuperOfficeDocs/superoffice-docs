# Quote management

[!include[License requirement](../includes/req-sales-prem.md)]

In sales, a quote allows a prospective buyer to see the **costs of selected products and/or services**. It can contain multiple **alternatives** for the customer to choose between.

## ERP

You might be working with a tenant that is integrated with an ERP system.
In that case, the ERP connection determines where the product information and prices are obtained from.

## Quote vs. other entities

When working with quotes, data will often intersect with the following entities:

* [documents][1]
* [follow-ups][2] (appointment table)
* [company][3] (contact table)
* [contact][4] (person table)
* [project][5]
* [sale][6]

## Quote Connectors

SuperOffice has a simple product and pricelist system built in, but using [quote connectors][7] you can access products and pricelists in other systems from inside SuperOffice.
