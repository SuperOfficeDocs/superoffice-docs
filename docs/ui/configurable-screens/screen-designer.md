# The Screen Designer

[!include[Requirement](../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

The SuperOffice Screen Designer lets you design cards that make the most sense in your organization.

The **Layouts** list displays any existing screen layouts (usually the default layout), with a preview screen on the right.

The layouts are marked with status (published or draft) and the assigned user groups.

## Where do I start?

To open the Screen Designer, go to **Settings and maintenance** and select **Screen Designer** from the navigator.

* Drag and drop field into the editor
* Select a field to move it, or to update its settings

* Available settings depend on the selected field type

## Company

* One-line addresses: Adr1, ZipCode, City

* Admin > Fields > Company

## Contact

## Sale

* Sale stage component - handles available fields for open/stalled/lost/sold sales
* Completed checkbox always editable
* Timestamp on note
* Sale date on top
* Source and competitor always on Details tab (can also be added to main)

* New grid element

## Project

* Completed checkbox always editable
* Timestamp on note

## More tab

The More tab has all custom fields. You can add important custom fields other places.

Udef and extra fields are created as before.

### Undo changes

If you need to revert to an earlier version of the screen, you can access the following options from the **Task** button:

* **Reset to factory settings:** This option discards all changes and resets the screen layout to the standard layout delivered by SuperOffice.
* **Discard draft:** Discards all changes and resets to the published version of the screen layout.

## What if I don't use the Screen Designer?

When a customer publishes their first layout from the Screen Designer, page1 admin is gone. However, this ability is preserved you don't use the designer.

Without the Development Tools license, new cards take effects and the custom fields are displayed in two columns
