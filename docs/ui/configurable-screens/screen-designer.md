# The Screen Designer

[!include[Requirement](../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

The SuperOffice Screen Designer lets you design cards that make the most sense in your organization.

The **Layouts** list displays any existing screen layouts (usually the default layout), with a preview screen on the right.

* Fields: Here you can find all available data fields for the selected screen layout. Use the filter function to find specific fields.
* Elements: Here you can add various non-data elements such as labels, dividers, links and, buttons.
* Settings: Customize appearance of individual field.
* Columns: Choose how many columns (1-4) the fields and elements may occupy.
* Tabs: Can be added, rearranged, and deleted.

## More tab

The **More** tab has all custom fields. You probably want to go through and organize these. You can add important custom fields other places.

User-defined fields (udef) and extra fields are created as before.

## Where do I start?

To open the Screen Designer, go to **Settings and maintenance** and select **Screen Designer** from the navigator.

* Drag and drop field into the editor.
* Select a field to move it, or to update its settings.
* Available settings depend on the selected field type.

### Undo changes

If you need to revert to an earlier version of the screen, you can access the following options from the **Task** button:

* **Reset to factory settings:** This option discards all changes and resets the screen layout to the standard layout delivered by SuperOffice.
* **Discard draft:** Discards all changes and resets to the published version of the screen layout.

## What if I don't use the Screen Designer?

Without the Development Tools license, new cards take effects and the custom fields are displayed in two columns.

<!-- When a customer publishes their first layout from the Screen Designer, page1 admin is gone. However, this ability is preserved you don't use the designer. -->
