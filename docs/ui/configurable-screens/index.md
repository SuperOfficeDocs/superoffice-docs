# Configurable screens

[!include[Requirement](../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

**Configurable screens** gives CRM Administrators a unified way of customizing the SuperOffice CRM user interface.

The **Screen Designer** in Settings and maintenance replaces [PageBuilder][1] and the old way of customizing the UI - screen by screen.

## Which screens can I configure?

* Company
* Contact
* Sale
* Project

## What can I customize?

* Modify the system layout of one or more screens for all users to fit the specific needs of your organization.
* Add personalized views for user groups to make them more effective.
* Design layouts optimized for specific project types and sales types.
* Hide fields that are never used.
* Give easy access to important custom fields.
* Add custom buttons and links. For example, to run a CRMScript.
* Organize custom fields in the **More** tab.
* Add tabs for fields related to a specific area.
* Remove unused tabs.

## Layouts

The system layout applies to all users unless you have created and assigned custom layouts to some users.
