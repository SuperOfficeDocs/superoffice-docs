If you delete a layout, user groups assigned to it, will go back to the default layout.

1. Open the Screen Designer.
2. Select a card at the top: Company, Contact, Sale, or Project.
3. Select a layout in the list on the left side.
4. Click the **Used by** field. Your options depend on the card.

    * Company and contact: Select one or more user groups.
    * Sale: First select assignment method (user group or sale type), then select the specific groups or types.
    * Project: First select assignment method (user group or project type), then select the specific groups or types.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A user group can only be assigned to one layout per screen.
