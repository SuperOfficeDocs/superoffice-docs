# Error removal

In a user interface it can be hard to predict where the user will click next. Sometimes the user will click in the wrong place. This might be a mistake.

The wrong thing to do is to complain to the user with a dialog box: “Don’t click there”

The user is trying to get work done. Anything that gets between the user and the work is annoying. A dialog that tells him he was stupid is not helping, and he has to click a button to get rid of it.

If you disable the button when it does not work, the user can see that clicking it won’t work. Ideally, you should put in a tooltip explaining what the user needs to do to get the button to work.
