# Add a tab

[!include[Requirement](../../../../common/includes/req-dev-tools.md)]

You can add custom tabs, for example, for fields related to a specific area.

To add a new tab:

1. Click **Add**. The **Columns** section opens to the left.

2. Under Tab title, replace the text "New tab" with the new tab name.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also add the tab name in other languages.

3. Select the number of columns you want to use in the new tab.

> [!TIP]
> If you later want to rename the tab, select the tab and select **Columns**. You can't rename any of the default tabs.
