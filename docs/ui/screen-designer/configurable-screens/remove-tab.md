# Remove a tab

Whether you've added a tab that's become irrelevant or there's a tab some or all groups in your organization doesn't use, it can likely be removed.

Layouts must have at least one tab. If there is only one tab remaining, you can't remove it.

> [!NOTE]
> If the tab contains any mandatory fields, you must move those to another tab before deleting the current tab.

To remove a tab:

1. Select the tab.
1. Click **Task** and select **Remove tab**.
