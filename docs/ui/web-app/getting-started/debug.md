# Debugging the Web application

How do we debug the web client? For starters, all the web browsers have developer tools either built-in or available as a plugin.

* Firefox: Download the Firebug Plugin
* IE8+: Built-in (F12)
* Chrome: Built-in (Ctrl-Shift-J)
* Safari: Built-in (Ctrl-Alt-I)

With these tools, you can get an overview of the current HTML styles and execute JavaScript code. In addition to the browser debuggers, we have some simple tools to help you make sense of what's happening inside.

## Diagnostics viewer

`Diagnostics.aspx`

![diagnostics][img1]

This webpage can be used to check whether your config file modifications are being picked up.

## The Debug window

If you want to debug closer to your codebase, you can use our **Debug** window to catch trace messages from the application:

```javascript
debug.trace("My trace", "My category");
```

This JavaScript code above will produce the following output:

![debug 1][img1]

### How to open the Debug window

There are several ways to open the debug window. Type the following into the address bar of your favorite browser:

```javascript
javascript:debug.openWindow();
```

The debug window is now active for the current page and will receive all traces from the code.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use this for dialogs, a new debug window must be opened for each dialog.

Go ahead and enter the following lines into the address bar (one at the time):

```javascript
javascript:debug.trace("My trace", "My category");
javascript:debug.warning("My warning trace", "My category");
javascript:debug.error("My error trace", "My category");
```

You should see something like this in your debug window:

![debug 2][img2]

The output is quite straightforward:

* Time of trace
* (xxxms) Time in milliseconds since the last trace was written
* Category in green (Clickable, allows filtering on a specific category)
* Trace text

When you open the **Debug** window, you will notice a lot of traces going on when navigation the application. We utilize the trace output a lot. Take a look at the combined script file to check it out.

> [!NOTE]
> The debug window will survive a refresh of the page it's connected to.

### Create a keyboard shortcut (socustom.js)

> [!NOTE]
> This will only work in S&M 7.Web

During the loading of a new page, the application will be looking for a JavaScript file named *socustom.js* in the root folder. Any scripts inside this file will be executed for the main page and any dialogs opened.

Let's say we want to open the **Debug** window when we press Ctrl-F9 inside the web application.

**To enable:**

1. Create a new file *socustom.js* and place it in the root folder.

2. Add the following JavaScript code to the file:

```javascript
$j(document).ready(function() {
  KeyPressHandler.AddKeyPressListenerByKeyCode(
    120, //F9
    ModifyKey.CTRL,
    'debug.openWindow();');
});
```

**To use:**

1. Open the application or press F5
2. Press Ctrl-F9

There you are. The preferred way to open the **Debug** window. And no debug code you will have to remember to remove before shipping to the customer!
