# How to open the Appointment dialog

The following example shows how we can open an Appointment dialog based on a given Appointment\_id. "appoinmtnet\_id = 124". When the \[dialog=stop\] parameter is used it stops the user from going to another page by any means exposed in the page such as buttons and links.

`www.example.com/Default.aspx?appointment[dialog=stop]?appointment_id=124`
