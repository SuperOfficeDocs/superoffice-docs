# Enable debug for Ribbons

As with Mail Link, Ribbons logs to *%AppData%\\SuperOffice* folder. It logs to the *Ribbons.log* file by default.

You may also specify the location for the log file by setting the logpath in [SuperOffice.ini][1].

Please note that logging for Ribbons is only turned on if both these values are set in *SuperOffice.ini*:

```text
[Error]
EnableDebug = 1
EnableRibbonLog = 1
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Running Ribbon vsto file can cause issues and this should not be done. Read more info on the [Community forum][2].
