**Automation** allows an application to execute code when an event occurs inside the client. These events occur when an action takes place such as when a dialog is opened, or a person is created.

While automation code is usually defined by customer requirements, consultants often create routines that assist with common tasks. Automation code can perform just about any task imaginable, but generally involve validating, transforming, and/or moving data. These types of routines are commonly discussed in the [developer forums][1].

Internal automation APIs are very useful for managing predetermined routines based on customers' requirements and providing user interaction within the application. They can make complex multiple-step tasks easier by programmatically automating the mundane details letting the user focus on the task at hand.
