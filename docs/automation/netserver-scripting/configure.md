# How to configure scripting

When installing SuperOffice CRM Web, a new scripting section is added to the web applications *web.config* file. If upgrading from a previous version, optionally run the *SoAppConfig.exe* configuration utility.

**SoAppConfig.exe utility with the Scripting section displayed:**

The configuration options are:

* Enabling scripting overall.
* The path to the folder where the scripts are stored. If no path is set, the \[ArchivePath\]\\scripts is used.
* The timeout limit is how much time is allowed on synchronous scripts. Asynchronous scripts are not affected by the limit.
* The Script violation limit is the number of times a script can violate the time limit before being disabled.

The *SoAppConfig.exe* utility will the section as seen in Listing One in *web.config*.

*SoAppConfig*: Scripting section added to the application configuration file.

```XML
<Scripting>
  <add key="EnableScripting" value="False" />
  <add key="ScriptPath" value="" />
  <add key="TimeoutLimit" value="20000" />
  <add key="MaxTimeouts" value="5" />
</Scripting>
```

## Document section

One more important configuration section is the documents section. The reason for this is that each script runs in a separate appdomain than NetServer services, and the scripting app domain dynamically creates a separate configuration file for that appdomain. This temporary configuration file, named *webScriptEngine.config*, is saved and read from the Document's `TemporaryPath` value. Make sure this path exists and that document permission settings are correct to read and write from this location.

```xml
<Documents\>
  ...
  <addkey\="TemporaryPath"value\="C:\\Temp" />
</Documents\>
```
