       Int32  personId,

Executes before the service method is invoked.

```cs
    static void AfterChangePersonImage(
       Int32  personId,
       Int32  blobId,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method has been invoked. The service waits for this method to complete before returning the result to the caller.
This service call has no return value, so there is no **returnValue** parameter
Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
## AfterChangePersonImageAsync
```cs
    static void AfterChangePersonImageAsync(
       Int32  personId,
       Int32  blobId,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```

Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
