Scripting events called on the <see cref='M:SuperOffice.CRM.Services.IAssociateAgent.LogOffWindowsUsers'>LogOffWindowsUsers</see> method on the <see cref='IAssociateAgent'>IAssociateAgent</see>  service agent.

       Int32[]  associateIds,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method has been invoked. The service waits for this method to complete before returning the result to the caller.

       Int32[]  associateIds,
       ref object  eventState
      );
