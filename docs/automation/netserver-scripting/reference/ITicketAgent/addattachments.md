    static void BeforeAddAttachments(
       Int32  ticketMessageEntityId,
       Int32[]  attachmentIds,

## AfterAddAttachments
```cs
    static void AfterAddAttachments(
       Int32  ticketMessageEntityId,
       Int32[]  attachmentIds,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method has been invoked. The service waits for this method to complete before returning the result to the caller.
This service call has no return value, so there is no **returnValue** parameter
Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
## AfterAddAttachmentsAsync
```cs
    static void AfterAddAttachmentsAsync(
       Int32  ticketMessageEntityId,
       Int32[]  attachmentIds,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```

The service call is not blocked waiting for this method to complete.
Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
