       Int32[]  addCompanyInterests,
       Int32[]  removeCompanyInterests,
       Int32[]  addContactInterests,
       Int32[]  removeContactInterests,
       ref object  eventState
      );

## AfterAddRemoveContactSelectionMemberInterests

       Int32[]  addContactInterests,
       Int32[]  removeContactInterests,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method has been invoked. The service waits for this method to complete before returning the result to the caller.

       Int32[]  addContactInterests,
       Int32[]  removeContactInterests,
       ref object  eventState
      );

Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
