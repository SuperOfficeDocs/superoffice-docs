Scripting events called on the <see cref='M:SuperOffice.CRM.Services.IForeignSystemAgent.DeleteForeignAppEntity'>DeleteForeignAppEntity</see> method on the <see cref='IForeignSystemAgent'>IForeignSystemAgent</see>  service agent.

```cs
    static void BeforeDeleteForeignAppEntity(
       Int32  foreignAppEntityId,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```

    static void AfterDeleteForeignAppEntity(
       Int32  foreignAppEntityId,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method has been invoked. The service waits for this method to complete before returning the result to the caller.
This service call has no return value, so there is no **returnValue** parameter
Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
## AfterDeleteForeignAppEntityAsync
```cs
    static void AfterDeleteForeignAppEntityAsync(
       Int32  foreignAppEntityId,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method is invoked, without waiting for the call to return.
The service call is not blocked waiting for this method to complete.
Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
