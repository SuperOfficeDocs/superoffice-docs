       String  tableName,
       Int32  id,
       StringDictionary  values,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes before the service method is invoked.

    static void AfterUpdateRow(
       String  tableName,
       Int32  id,
       StringDictionary  values,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method has been invoked. The service waits for this method to complete before returning the result to the caller.
This service call has no return value, so there is no **returnValue** parameter
Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
## AfterUpdateRowAsync
```cs
    static void AfterUpdateRowAsync(
       String  tableName,
       Int32  id,
       StringDictionary  values,
       ref object  eventState
      );
```
Executes after the service method is invoked, without waiting for the call to return.
The service call is not blocked waiting for this method to complete.
Any state you set in the **Before** method is passed in through the *eventState* parameter.
