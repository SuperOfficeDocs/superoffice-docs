Explicit downcast from a generic to a Time. If the generic does not represent the correct type, an exception is thrown. Together with `getTypeName()`, this function can be used to get an explicit typed variable.

* **generic:** Generic The variable to downcast
* **Returns:** Time The variable as a Time
