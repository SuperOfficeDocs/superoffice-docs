Sets the rate of outgoing emails pr. minute for this shipment. This is required for a shipment. If you specify a value larger than eJournal actually can handle, it will send at full speed.
Warning: this can lower performance of both eJournal and your mail server if set too high.



* **sendRate:** The number of emails pr. minute sent from eJournal
