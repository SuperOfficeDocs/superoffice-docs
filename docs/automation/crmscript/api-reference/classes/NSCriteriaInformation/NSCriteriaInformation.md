Carrier for criteria information. It contains all the search criteria - that is, ArchiveRestrictionInfo - objects, including a  column specification. In addition, it contains the same criteria expressed as an archive, with an array of NSArchiveColumnInfo specifications and a set of ArchiveRow rows. The rows of the archive form a subset of the restriction array.
