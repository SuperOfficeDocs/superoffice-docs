# Getting started with CRMScript

When you are ready to start learning CRMScript:

* Explore the topics in the [Fundamentals][1] section. Try out the interactive script snippets for yourself. You can modify the code and run it to see the effects.

* Familiarize yourself with the [simple data types][2].

* Adopt our [coding conventions][3] and [best practices][4].

* Learn about error handling and [debugging][5].

* Ask your questions in the [!include[forums](includes/link-forum-cs.md)].

* [!include[register as a developer](includes/link-register-dev.md)] to get access to your own sandbox environment and start exploring interaction with SuperOffice.

To develop applications and scripts in our SOD environment is free. Required licenses apply only in production (live).
