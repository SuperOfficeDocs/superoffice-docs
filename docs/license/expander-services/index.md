# Expander Services

You can customize SuperOffice to fit your business model and needs through options available in the **Settings and maintenance** module.

However, sometimes you need more than what is available out-of-the-box. For those instances, we have Expander Services, which contains a range of tools you can use to create one-off customizations of your SuperOffice CRM solution.

## What is Expander Services?

**Expander Services** is our name for a set of tools that allow you to customize your CRM solution and to integrate other applications with SuperOffice. These tools extend beyond the standard configuration options offered to you out-of-the-box in the **Settings and maintenance** module.

Expander Services is a **subscription-based** license available to all customers. It doesn’t matter if you run SuperOffice CRM in the cloud or have it installed on your premises.

When you subscribe to Expander Services, you get access to the following [tools][1]:

* [CRMScript][2]: Customize your own workflows and automation
* Extra tables: Add new tables to the database and increase your flexibility
* Custom screens: Create new screens in Service to support your specific processes
* SuperOffice APIs: Create customizations by using developers' tools

Information about SuperOffice APIs is available on this site, where you and your partners (regardless of whether you have Expander Services or not) can find extensive documentation, tips, examples, forum groups, and support tools related to various customizations. Feel free to register and sign in to the community.

## How does Expander Services work?

When you subscribe to Expander Services, additional options become available in the **Settings and maintenance** module.

The license is added to your [tenant][4] through SuperOffice Operation Center and billed monthly to the customer.

You may continue to use Expander Servicers as often you like until you cancel the subscription. You may add as many customizations that you want without affecting the subscription fee.

No [custom application][5] will be made available to your SuperOffice CRM Online solution unless subscribed. If the customer cancels their subscription, the application will be deactivated/unavailable.

## When do you need to buy Expander Services?

If you need access to the SuperOffice APIs or any of the [advanced extensibility features][1], you probably need to subscribe to Expander Services. Pricing is listed at [superoffice.com][3].

| Scenario/envir | Online | On-premise |
|----------------|--------|------------|
| Use customization tools in Settings and maintenance | no | no |
| Publish standard application | no (embedded) | yes |
| Activate custom application | yes | yes |

You *don't* need to buy Expander Services to use the standard customization tools available in the **Settings and maintenance** module. You are free to customize your solution using, for example, your definition of lists, privacy settings, templates, sales and project guides, user-defined fields, and SuperMacros.

Furthermore, you *don't* need an Expander Services license if your company runs SuperOffice CRM in the cloud and you want to use any of the [standard applications][6] available in [the SuperOffice App Store][7].

However, if you are running SuperOffice CRM on your premises, you *always* need to have Expander Services to add integrations or customizations to your solution, whether these are customized for you or standard add-ons.

The same goes for all [custom SuperOffice CRM Online applications][5]. You can either build your own or [contact vendors directly][8] and find out what options there are to create a tailored version of these applications for your business. The vendors can tell you whether an application is available for you if you run SuperOffice CRM on your premises.

## How do I get Expander Services?

Application developers get access to Expander Services [when registering][9]. Customers can contact their local SuperOffice partner or representative to get recommendations for their specific business needs.
