# SuperOffice user plans and subscriptions

You can choose from 3 stand-alone **solutions** - Sales, Marketing, and Service - based on different roles in your company. Within each solution there are tiers - the **Essential** and **Premium** plan. Find the correct plans to base your application on.

All solutions can have different add-ons. An add-on is a software extension that adds extra features to a program. It may extend certain functions within the program's interface, or give the program additional capabilities.

User plans are identified by the `ExtraFlags` field being 1 on their module license records, and the `"set="` in their `ExtraInfo` field.

## How do user plans affect my app?

A customer can choose 1 of the following billing periods for their CRM solution:

* once a month
* very 3 months
* every 6 months
* annually

The contract period is for 12 months. After the first 12 months, they are automatically renewed for another billing period, according to their choice.

Customers can combine plans that best fit their needs. They can also add or change user plans later on.

You should keep this flexibility in mind when integrating with specific features and deciding your pricing model.
