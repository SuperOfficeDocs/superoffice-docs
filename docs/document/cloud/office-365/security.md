# Considerations / security

We currently do not support adding the App to a "Site Collection". The folder needs to be a relative path to the root of the SharePoint site.

## Default access permission on documents

Documents created via SuperOffice that are hosted in SharePoint will be given a default permission based upon what access rights are set on the SharePoint folder.
