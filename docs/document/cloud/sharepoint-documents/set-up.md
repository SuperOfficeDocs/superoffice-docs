# How to set up Microsoft 365 SharePoint

The set-up of the SharePoint site and document libraries is quite flexible, but we recommend to create a separate SharePoint site for your SuperOffice documents, and 2 document libraries: one for documents and a separate document library for templates.

## Step 1 - Create a SharePoint site in your Microsoft 365 SharePoint

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to use **Visible for**, we recommend to set up the SharePoint site with a Microsoft 365 "service user", to avoid normal users (personal) / SuperOffice users do not have owner-rights.
>
> See the [reference of permissions in SharePoint​][1] for more information.

1. Open Microsoft 365 and sign in.
2. Open SharePoint from the menu.
3. Click **Create site**.
