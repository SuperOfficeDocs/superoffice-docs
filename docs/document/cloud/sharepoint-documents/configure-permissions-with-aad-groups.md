# How to set up SharePoint using site permissions and Domain (AAD) groups

We recommend that you use domain (AAD) groups to control access to you SuperOffice document site in SharePoint​. All your user administration will be in Azure Portal, you will maintain group members there​.

If you plan to **use Visible for** (or already using this in CRM):​

AAD groups is the only way to set permissions in SharePoint according to your SuperOffice user groups​. We recommend (if not already) that you create corresponding groups in AAD to your SuperOffice user groups​.

If you plan **NOT to use Visible for**:​

We recommend that you use domain (AAD) group and not the SharePoint groups.​ Then you will have one place to handle users and permissions, and by adding users to this group in AAD when creating them – you will not have to add them again in SharePoint.

## Step 1 – Navigate to the site where the SuperOffice document library reside​

To give users permissions to create, delete and edit SuperOffice documents in SharePoint, you need to give them access / permissions to the site where the document library reside​.

This will give them access to the document library too.

1. In your SuperOffice document Site - click on the cog-wheel and then **Site permissions**.

2. Click on **Advanced permissions settings**

## Step 3 – Grant permissions​

1. Click on **Grant Permissions**.

2. In **Invite people**, type in and add domain (AAD) groups​. Members of these groups will automatically get access.

3. Tick off **Send an email invitation**. (There will be a lot of emails that the users will wonder about​.)

4. Make sure the permission level is **Edit**.​

5. When your done adding groups, press **Share**.​

## Step 4 – Review the SharePoint site groups​

​Members of the SharePoint site group Owners (Permission Levels Full Control), will have access to all content on that site. Including all folders and documents.​

Make sure there are no user accounts in this group. Only service accounts.​
