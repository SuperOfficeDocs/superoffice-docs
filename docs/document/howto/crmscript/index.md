# Documents

Letters, memos, sale proposals, order confirmations, terms & conditions - there's a huge amount of **documents** pertaining to customer relations. This section takes a deep dive into how to manage those documents with CRMScript.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't confuse *document* entities with documents in the customer service knowledge base or entities connected to Super Office Quote!

## Document properties vs. the file itself

Information **about** the document is stored in the [document table][1] and managed through the `NSDocumentAgent` and its corresponding carriers.

The document **files** we are dealing with here are stored in a central repository (so_arc).

## Documents vs. activities

Documents are part of a broader group of entities labeled **activities**:

* follow-ups
  * appointment
  * task
  * call
* documents
  * document (this section)
  * email
* mailings and form submissions
* chat sessions

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to understand the distinction between activities and documents. When you get data from the [appointment table][5] or use the CRMScript [NSAppointment class][6], it is crucial that you pay attention to the **type** field.

There's always a corresponding appointment record for a document. You can navigate the relation between them in both directions. Each document-type appointment record has a corresponding document record - always. However, the document-type appointments are not visible in the UI and they should not be mistaken for **linked activities**.
