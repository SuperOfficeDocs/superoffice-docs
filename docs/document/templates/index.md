# Sales template variables

You will always find a list of template variables when you click for help in the maintenance client or at our [help center][1].

However, when we release new service releases there may be new template variables added that will not be available in the help-files yet. This page is where it is first updated.

If you encounter a problem with templates check [Document templates troubleshooting][2].
