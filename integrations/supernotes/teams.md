# Teams

Find answers to common questions about organizing workspace members into teams.

## What are teams and why should I use them?

Teams allow you to organize workspace members into smaller groups for better collaboration. Teams are useful for:

* **Sharing meeting prompts:** with specific colleagues instead of the entire workspace.
* **Organizing your workspace:** by department, project, or function.
* **More targeted content sharing:** with relevant team members.

Instead of sharing a custom meeting prompt with your entire workspace (which may include people who don't need it), you can share it only with your team members.

More team features will be added in the future, making teams an increasingly powerful way to collaborate.

## How do I create a team?

Only workspace administrators can create teams. To create a team:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Workspace**.
2. Navigate to the **Teams** tab.
3. Click **Create Team**.
4. Enter a team name and optional description.
5. Choose a color for easy identification.
6. Click **Create**.

Once created, you can add workspace members to the team and assign team leads.

## What is a team lead and what can they do?

A team lead is a member with additional permissions within a specific team. Team leads can:

* Add new members to the team.
* Remove members from the team.
* Edit the team name and description.

> [!NOTE]
> Team leads cannot delete the team - only workspace administrators can do that.

### To assign a team lead

1. Expand the team in the Teams tab.
2. Click the three-dot menu next to a member.
3. Select **Make Team Lead**.

## How do I add members to a team?

To add members to a team, you need to be either a workspace administrator or a team lead for that team:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Workspace** > **Teams**.
2. Click on the team to expand it.
3. Click **Add Member**.
4. Select a workspace member from the dropdown.
5. Choose their role (Member or Team Lead).
6. Click **Add**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only add people who are already members of your workspace. If someone isn't in the workspace yet, they need to be invited to the workspace first.

## How do I share meeting prompts with my team?

When creating or editing a meeting prompt, you can choose to share it with your teams instead of the entire workspace:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Meeting Types (Prompts)**.
2. Create a new prompt or edit an existing one.
3. Enable **Share with Teams** toggle.
4. Save the prompt.

When this option is enabled, all members of teams you belong to will be able to see and use your prompt. This is more targeted than workspace sharing, which makes the prompt visible to everyone in the workspace.

> [!TIP]
> You can enable both "Share with Teams" and "Share with Workspace" if you want maximum visibility, or choose just one for more controlled sharing.

## What's the difference between sharing with teams vs. workspace?

When sharing meeting prompts, you have two options:

### Share with workspace

Everyone in your workspace can see and use the prompt. Best for company-wide templates that all employees should use.

### Share with teams

Only members of teams you belong to can see and use the prompt. Best for department-specific or project-specific templates.

**Example:** If you're on the Sales team and create a "Customer Discovery Call" prompt, sharing it with your team means only Sales team members see it, while sharing with workspace means everyone including Engineering, Marketing, etc. can see it.

**Recommendation:** Use team sharing when the prompt is only relevant to specific groups. Use workspace sharing for general-purpose prompts that everyone might find useful.
