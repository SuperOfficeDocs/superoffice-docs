* **Meeting transcription and recording:** capture your meetings automatically.
* **Creating AI-powered meeting summaries:** get structured summaries after each meeting.
* **Organizing meetings in projects:** group related meetings for shared context.
* **Detecting action items and decisions:** automatically identify key outcomes during meetings.

Supernotes is designed to free up time for professional discussions and reduce time spent writing meeting minutes and finding previous decisions. The goal is more effective meetings and higher quality work.

## How do I connect my calendar to Supernotes?

To connect your calendar and enable Supernotes to join your meetings:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Calendar**.
2. Click the connect button for your calendar provider.
3. Select the account you use for your regular meeting calendar.
4. Grant the necessary permissions.
5. Verify that your upcoming meetings appear in Supernotes.

Once connected, Supernotes will be able to see your meeting schedule and join meetings based on your settings.

## What meeting platforms does Supernotes support?

Supernotes currently supports the following platforms:

| Platform          | Status                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Teams   | Fully supported                   |
| Google Meet       | Fully supported                   |
| Zoom              | Fully supported                   |
| Physical meetings | Supported (with recording device) |

## How do I manually send Supernotes to a meeting?

If Supernotes doesn't automatically join a meeting, you can manually send it:

1. Click **Send Supernotes to meeting** button in the top right corner of the dashboard.
2. Paste the meeting link (Teams, Google Meet, etc.).
3. Click **Send Supernotes to meeting**.

Supernotes will join the meeting and begin transcription once it's admitted.

## What are the meeting duration limits?

Supernotes has the following time limits for meetings:

| Parameter              | Limit                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum meeting length | 5 hours                                                        |
| Inactivity timeout     | 45 minutes (Supernotes leaves after 45 minutes of no activity) |

For meetings longer than 5 hours, you may need to restart Supernotes or split the meeting into sessions.

## How do I reconnect my calendar if settings changes aren't applying?

If your settings changes aren't being reflected in upcoming meetings, you may need to reconnect your calendar:

1. Click the three dots above the calendar.
2. Select **Reconnect calendar**.
3. Select the correct account (your usual meeting calendar).
4. Complete the authorization steps.
5. Verify Supernotes appears in your upcoming meetings.

> [!TIP]
> After reconnecting, it may take a few minutes for all meetings to sync.

## What is the first-time setup process?

When you first access Supernotes, you'll go through a simple onboarding process:

1. **Verify your identity:** Sign in using your Google or Microsoft account to verify your email domain and identity.
2. **Join or create a workspace (required):** This is the most important step. If your company already has a workspace, you'll see an option to join it. If you're the first person from your company, you'll create a new workspace.
3. **Connect your calendar:** Connect your Google Calendar or Microsoft Calendar so Supernotes can see your upcoming meetings and automatically join them.

> [!NOTE]
> Always join your company's workspace first. This prevents duplicate note-takers from joining the same meeting when multiple colleagues have Supernotes enabled. Your past meetings are NOT shared when joining a workspace - only future meetings where workspace members participate together will be accessible to all participants.

## How does the AI note taker work?

Supernotes uses an AI-powered bot that joins your video meetings as a participant. The bot:

* Appears with a branded avatar in your meeting.
* Records audio from all participants.
* Generates transcriptions and summaries after the meeting ends.

There are two ways to have Supernotes join your meetings:

### Option 1: Toggle from calendar (recommended)

1. Go to the Home page in Supernotes.
2. Find your meeting in the calendar on the left side.
3. Click the toggle switch next to the meeting to enable the note taker.

### Option 2: Manual join

1. Copy your meeting link.
2. Go to Supernotes and select **Send Supernotes to meeting**.
3. Paste the meeting link.

## How do I record physical meetings?

Supernotes can also record in-person meetings where there's no video conference.

### How to record physical meetings

1. Open Supernotes on your phone (via web browser).
2. Log into your account.
3. Tap the large **Physical Meeting** button on the home screen.
4. Place your phone in the center of the table.
5. The phone's microphone will capture all voices.

### Best practices for physical meetings

* **Enable Do Not Disturb mode:** incoming calls or notifications will interrupt the recording.
* **Use Flight Mode (optional):** prevents any interruptions while still recording.
* **Place phone centrally:** phone microphones are designed for 360-degree audio capture.
* **Ensure phone is charged:** long meetings require sufficient battery.

> [!NOTE]
> Physical meetings follow the same limits as virtual meetings: maximum duration of 4 hours 15 minutes, and auto-stop after 45 minutes of silence.

## Can I use Supernotes on mobile?

Yes, Supernotes works on mobile devices through your web browser. While not a native app, the web experience is mobile-optimized.

### What you can do on mobile

* Record physical meetings using your phone's microphone.
* View meeting summaries and transcriptions.
* Search past meetings.
* Share summaries with others.

### Some limitations compared to desktop

* Calendar view is simplified for smaller screens.
* Editing features are more limited.
* Full dashboard experience is optimized for larger screens.

> [!TIP]
> Mobile works great for recording physical meetings. See "How do I record physical meetings?" for best practices on using your phone to capture in-person discussions.

## What is People Directory and how can I use it?

## Can I upload my own files or audio recordings for transcription?

### For audio recordings

1. Go to the **Record** page from the main menu.
2. You can record directly in your browser, or upload existing audio files.
3. Supported formats include common audio types like MP3, WAV, and M4A.
4. After upload, Supernotes transcribes the audio and generates a summary.

### For documents

1. Navigate to any **Project**.
2. Go to the **Files** section.
3. Upload PDF or Word documents (up to 10MB).
