# Getting started

* **Creating AI-powered meeting summaries:** get structured summaries after each meeting.
* **Organizing meetings in projects:** group related meetings for shared context.
* **Detecting action items and decisions:** automatically identify key outcomes during meetings.

Supernotes is designed to free up time for professional discussions and reduce time spent writing meeting minutes and finding previous decisions. The goal is more effective meetings and higher quality work.

## What meeting platforms does Supernotes support?

Supernotes currently supports the following platforms:

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Teams | Fully supported |
| Google Meet | Fully supported |
| Zoom | Fully supported |
| Physical meetings | Supported (with recording device) |

## <a id="send-manually"></a>How do I manually send Supernotes to a meeting?

If Supernotes doesn't automatically join a meeting, you can manually send it:

1. Click the **Send Supernotes to meeting** button in the upper-right corner of the dashboard.
1. Paste the meeting link (Teams, Google Meet, or similar).
1. Click **Send Supernotes to meeting**.

Supernotes will join the meeting and begin transcription once it's admitted.

## <a id="meeting-duration-limits"></a>What are the meeting duration limits?

Supernotes has the following time limits for meetings:

| Parameter | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Maximum meeting length | 5 hours |
| Inactivity timeout | 45 minutes (Supernotes leaves after 45 minutes of no activity) |

For meetings longer than 5 hours, you may need to restart Supernotes or split the meeting into sessions.

## How do I reconnect my calendar if settings changes aren't applying?

If your settings changes aren't being reflected in upcoming meetings, you may need to reconnect your calendar:

1. Click the three dots above the calendar.
1. Select **Reconnect calendar**.
1. Select the correct account (your usual meeting calendar).
1. Complete the authorization steps.
1. Verify Supernotes appears in your upcoming meetings.

> [!TIP]
> After reconnecting, it may take a few minutes for all meetings to sync.

## What is the first-time setup process?

When you first access Supernotes, you'll go through a simple onboarding process:

1. **Verify your identity:** Sign in using your Google or Microsoft account to verify your email domain and identity.
1. **Join or create a workspace (required):** This is the most important step. If your company already has a workspace, you'll see an option to join it. If you're the first person from your company, you'll create a new workspace.
1. **Connect your calendar:** Connect your Google Calendar or Microsoft Calendar so Supernotes can see your upcoming meetings and automatically join them.

> [!NOTE]
> Always join your company's workspace first to prevent duplicate note-takers in meetings. For more details, see [Workspaces][4].

## How does the AI note taker work?

Supernotes uses an AI-powered assistant that joins your video meetings as a participant. The assistant:

* Appears with a branded avatar in your meeting.
* Records audio from all participants.
* Generates transcriptions and summaries after the meeting ends.

For details on enabling the note taker for specific meetings, see [How do I enable the note taker for a specific meeting?][5]

## How do I record physical meetings?

Supernotes can also record in-person meetings where there's no video conference.

### How to record physical meetings

1. Open Supernotes on your phone (via web browser).
1. Log in to your account.
1. Tap the large **Physical Meeting** button on the home screen.

### Best practices for physical meetings

* **Enable Do Not Disturb mode:** incoming calls or notifications will interrupt the recording.
* **Use Flight Mode (optional):** prevents any interruptions while still recording.
* **Place phone centrally:** phone microphones are designed for 360-degree audio capture.
* **Ensure phone is charged:** long meetings require sufficient battery.

> [!NOTE]
> Physical meetings follow the same limits as virtual meetings: maximum duration of 5 hours, and auto-stop after 45 minutes of silence.
