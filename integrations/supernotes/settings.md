# Settings

Find answers to common questions about configuring SuperNotes.

## What does "Auto Schedule" do?

This setting controls whether SuperNotes automatically joins your meetings:

| Setting | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled | SuperNotes automatically joins all meetings. You can exclude individual meetings from the dashboard. |
| Disabled | SuperNotes doesn't automatically join. You manually select which meetings SuperNotes should attend. |

Find this in **Settings** > **Profile**.

## How do I control which meetings SuperNotes joins?

You have several options:

### Per-meeting toggle

On any meeting card, use the **SuperNotes is attending** toggle to include or exclude that specific meeting.

### Auto schedule setting

In **Settings** > **Profile**, toggle **Auto Schedule** to control the default behavior for all meetings.

### Internal meetings setting

Separately control whether SuperNotes joins internal meetings (within your organization).

## <a id="retention-options"></a>What are the recording retention options?

Recording retention controls how long audio/video files are stored:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 30 days | Recordings stored for 30 days before automatic deletion. |
| 7 days | Recordings stored for 7 days before automatic deletion. |
| 0 days | Recordings deleted immediately after transcription processing. |

> [!NOTE]
> Text transcriptions are stored as long as your account exists, regardless of this setting.

## How do I control meeting summary email distribution?

The "Meeting Summary Email Preference" setting controls how summaries are distributed:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Send to all internal attendees | All internal participants receive email summaries automatically. |
| Save only in SuperNotes | Summaries are stored in SuperNotes but not automatically emailed. |

You can always manually share summaries using the shareable link feature.

## What is custom vocabulary and how do I use it?

Custom vocabulary helps improve transcription accuracy for organization-specific terms. Add words that:

* Are specific to your organization or industry.
* Are commonly mispronounced or misheard.
* Are technical terms, acronyms, or jargon.
* Are names of products, projects, or people.

### To add custom vocabulary

1. Go to **Settings** > **Custom Vocabulary**.
1. Add your organization-specific terms.
1. SuperNotes will prioritize these spellings during transcription.

## How do I set my default meeting type?

The default meeting type determines the template used for generating summaries:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Profile**.
1. Find **Default Meeting Type**.
1. Select from available templates.

### Available types

* General
* Customer meeting
* Internal meeting
* Custom templates you've created
