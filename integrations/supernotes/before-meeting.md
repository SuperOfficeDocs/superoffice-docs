# Before meeting

Find answers to common questions about pre-meeting features and preparation.

## What are pre-meeting research emails?

Pre-meeting research emails are AI-powered briefings sent 5-10 minutes before your meetings with external contacts. They help you prepare by providing background information on meeting participants.

### Which meetings receive pre-meeting emails

* Meetings with external attendees (people outside your organization).
* When participants have discoverable professional profiles.
* Non-private meetings (meetings marked as private/sensitive are skipped).
* External meetings (colleague-only meetings are skipped).

### Email contents

* **Company information:** logo, industry, size.
* **Current job role:** and description.
* **Top professional skills.**
* **Education background.**
* **AI-generated common ground:** based on your profiles.
* **Conversation starter suggestions.**
* **Interesting facts:** about attendees.

### Important notes

* Recurring meetings with the same participants won't trigger new emails.
* Up to 5 participants are shown per email.
* Emails are only sent on weekdays.

**To enable:** Go to **Settings** > **Profile** > Enable **Pre-meeting Briefing** under Emails & Summaries.

## What are recurring meeting summary emails?

For recurring meetings, Supernotes can send you the summary from the previous meeting instance 20-25 minutes before the next one starts. This helps you quickly catch up on what was discussed last time.

### How it works

1. Supernotes automatically detects recurring meetings from your calendar.
1. It finds the most recent summary from the same meeting series.
1. The summary is emailed to you before the next meeting.

### Requirements

* The meeting must be part of a recurring series.
* A previous meeting in the series must have been recorded with Supernotes.
* You must have access to the previous meeting's transcription.
* The meeting must not be marked as private.

### Email contents

* The full AI-generated summary from the last meeting.
* A link to view the complete transcription.
* Meeting title and date for context.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature uses the same "Pre-meeting Briefing" setting as pre-meeting research emails. Both are enabled together in **Settings** > **Profile**.
