# Create sale

To create a [sale][1] in SuperOffice directly from Outlook, follow these steps:

1. Open the email related to the activity.

1. In the **SuperOffice** Outlook sidebar, select **Create sale**.

1. Fill in the required fields:

    * **Sale amount:** Enter an estimated amount and select the currency (if this option is activated).
    * **Company:** Choose the relevant company from the list.
    * **Contact:** Select the person from the company for this sale.
    * **Project:** (Optional) Link the sale to an ongoing project if applicable.
    * **Type:** Choose the type of sale.
    * **Sale date:** Set the estimated date for the sale.
    * **Visible for:** Choose who can see the sale — everyone, only the owner’s primary group, or only the owner.
    * **Notes:** (Optional) Enter a more detailed description of the sale.

1. Once all fields are completed, click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Visible for** drop-down is only available to users whose administrator has enabled the required license.  
> For more details, see [**Admin - User Management - Visibility**](https://docs.superoffice.com/en/admin/user-management/index.html#visible).

> You can also create a follow-up or request directly from the email. If it is part of an ongoing issue, you can attach the message to a specific request.
