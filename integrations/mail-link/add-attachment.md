# Add SuperOffice document as attachment

When [creating an email from Microsoft Outlook][1] you can add documents from SuperOffice CRM as attachments.

1. In the email window, click the **Attach document** button (![icon][img1]).

2. In the **Include attachments** dialog under **Select from**, select one of the six radio buttons: **Company**, **Project**, **Sale**, **Selection**, **Author** or **Template**. The rest of the dialog changes accordingly.

3. Go to the dropdown directly below the radio buttons. What you may do here, depends on what you selected in the previous step:

    * If you selected **Company**, **Project**, **Sale** or **Selection** in the previous step, select the name of a company/project/learn/sale/learn/selection in the dropdown. You can also search by starting to type the name of the item in question.
    * If you selected **Author**, you may search for the author of the document by starting to type the person's name in the dropdown and then select from the matches that appear.
    * If you selected **Template**, you may select a template from the dropdown.

4. From the **Date range** dropdown, select the period when the documents you are looking for were created.

5. The leftmost list shows all documents that meet the criteria. Select a document and click ![icon][img2] to move it to the rightmost list.

6. Repeat step 5 if you would like to include more documents.

7. After selecting documents, click **OK** to attach them to your email.
