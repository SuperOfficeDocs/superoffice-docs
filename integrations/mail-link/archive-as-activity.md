## Steps

2. Click the **Archive email** button on the toolbar, and select **Create activity**.

3. If the sender of the email is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. [How to handle unlisted senders][1]

4. In the **Company** field, starting typing to search for a company name and then select from the matches that appear.

5. In the **Contact** field, select one of the contacts belonging to the company you selected in step 4. You can also start typing to search for the contact name.

6. Optionally, select a project and/or sale that you want to link the follow-up to.

7. Use the **Type** dropdown menu to select a follow-up type.

8. Click to select a **Date** and enter a **Time** of day. Today's date is automatically inserted, but can be changed.

9. In the **Visible for** field, click the arrow next to the field. From the list, choose if the activity should be visible to all users, private (visible only to the user defined as owner), or visible to all users in the user group that the owner belongs to.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Visible for** field is available only if this right is assigned to you in Settings and maintenance.

10. In the **Description** field, the subject and message body is automatically inserted. However, you may enter any text that you would like to be shown in SuperOffice CRM.

12. Click **OK**. The selected emails are archived to SuperOffice CRM as meetings.
