# SuperOffice Gmail Link

SuperOffice Gmail Link is a plug-in that links the Google Gmail client with SuperOffice. This means that among other things, you can:

* Archive incoming and outgoing emails and attachments from your Gmail account as documents in SuperOffice.
* Create diary activities in SuperOffice based on emails in Gmail.
* Create requests based on emails in Gmail.
* Look up senders in SuperOffice: easy-to-follow wizards that help you create a new company, contact or email address in your SuperOffice CRM database, if the sender is not unknown.
