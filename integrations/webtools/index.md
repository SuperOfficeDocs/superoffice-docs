# SuperOffice WebTools

SuperOffice WebTools bridges document editing in SuperOffice CRM with the associated applications on the user's desktop.

SuperOffice WebTools has 4 features:

* Download, edit and upload documents
* Alarm notifications
* Quick-login to SuperOffice by menu or double-clicking on the icon in the notification area
* Bridge between user-initiated actions in SuperOffice CRM Web and SuperOffice Mail Link

How it works is detailed in the [technical overview][2].

## Distribution

* SuperOffice Web will automatically detect new versions of WebTools and will offer the user to update. WebTools can also be downloaded manually from the Download menu inside SuperOffice.

* SuperOffice Windows users will receive new versions upon upgrading the Windows client or by manually downloading and installing from the [Download Service][1].
