# Archive email as a request

It is possible to archive an email in your mail client inbox as a request in SuperOffice Service. How this works, depends on if you are adding the email to a new or existing request.

## Create a new request

1. Select the email(s) you would like to archive. If you select more than one email, the procedure below is repeated for each email.

2. Click the **Archive email** button on the toolbar, and **Create request** from the dropdown.

3. In the **Archive as request** dialog, select **Create a new request**.

4. In the **Place request in this queue** field, select the request queue you would like to send the request to. Each queue has a specific category and priority assigned to it.

5. Check the **Remove from inbox** box if you would like to remove the email from the inbox and move it to the **Deleted items** folder in your mail client after it is successfully archived in SuperOffice Service.

6. Click **OK**. A confirmation message appears.

    * If the sender's email address is recognised, the request is automatically archived to the correct contact and company.
    * If the sender's email address is not recognised, the sender is automatically registered as a new contact in SuperOffice Service.

7. In the confirmation message, you may select **Click here to open request** if you would like to have a closer look at the request, or **Close** to close the confirmation message.

## Add a message to an existing request

1. Select the email(s) you would like to archive. If you select more than one email, the procedure below is repeated for each email.
2. Click the **Archive email** button on the toolbar, and **Create request** from the dropdown.
3. In the **Archive as request** dialog, select **Add message to existing request**.
4. In the search field, type the ID or the beginning of the title of the request.
5. Press **ENTER** or click the button with the magnifying glass to start the search. The requests matching your search criteria appear in the **Select request to add this message to** field.
6. Select the request you would like to add the email to.
7. Check the **Remove from inbox** box if you would like to remove the email from the inbox and move it to the **Deleted items** folder in your mail client after it is successfully archived in SuperOffice Service.
8. Click **OK**. A message appears to confirm that the request is updated. If the request had been closed earlier, it is now reactivated.
9. In the confirmation message, you may select **Click here to open request** if you would like to have a closer look at the request, or **Close** to close the confirmation message.
