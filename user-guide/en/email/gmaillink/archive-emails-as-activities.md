# Create activity

This feature allows you to quickly add an activity in SuperOffice based on the sender and the text content in the email message.

1. In the Gmail inbox, open an email.

2. Click the **More** button ( ![icon][img1] ) in the email toolbar.

3. Select **Create activity**. The dialog **Create activity in SuperOffice** opens.

    If the sender of the email is not listed in SuperOffice CRM, a warning will appear at the top of the dialog. A warning also appears if the sender is registered on multiple companies in SuperOffice CRM.

4. In the dialog, the **Company** and **Contact** fields have been filled in if the sender is registered in SuperOffice. Fill in relevant information in the following fields

    [!include[Options](includes/gmail-archiving-options.md)]

5. Click **Save**. The activity is saved in the **Activities** section tab in SuperOffice. Click the link in the pop-up message to open the activity in SuperOffice.
