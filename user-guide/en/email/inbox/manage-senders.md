## Look up sender in SuperOffice

You can easily look up information about a sender in SuperOffice CRM.

1. In the inbox, select an email.
2. Click the sender's name and email address in the email header.
3. What happens next, depends on if the sender's email address is found or not found in SuperOffice:
    * If the email address is found on a company/contact, the company/contact card is displayed.
    * If the email address is registered on more than one company/contact, a dialog will appear, listing the alternatives and allowing you to choose.
    * If the email address is not registered in SuperOffice CRM, you can click **Create new company and contact**.

## Add email addresses to SuperOffice CRM

If you want to add the sender's email address to a new or existing contact in SuperOffice, do as follows:

1. Go to the inbox.
2. Select a message in the inbox.
3. Click the sender's name and email address in the email header.
4. Click **Create new company and contact**. The **Add contact to SuperOffice** dialog opens.
5. Here you have the following options:
    * Search: Search for a company or contact to which you want to add the sender's email address.
    * **This contact could be...** : SuperOffice will try to match the sender with existing contacts in the database. Click one of the suggested contacts if it matches the sender.
    * **Create new company and contact**: Click this button if the sender is a new contact from a company not previously registered in SuperOffice.
    * **Do not add contact to SuperOffice**: If you are archiving an email message or creating a task, you can click this button if you do not want to register the sender's email address.
