# Send passwords to contacts

A contact who is going to have access to a customer centre needs a user name and password to log in to the customer centre. You send this information to the contact as follows:

1. Open the **Contact** screen.

2. Click the ![icon][img1] **Actions** button and select **Send password**. The **Send password to contact** screen appears.

3. Verify that the contents of the **To** (recipient address), **From** (sender address) and **Subject** fields are correct. If required, you can adjust the data that has been inserted automatically.

4. Click **Preview HTML** or **Preview plain text** to view the message that will be sent out.

    > [!TIP]
    > The content of the message is obtained from an installed system template. You can find this under **Knowledge Base &gt; Reply templates**.

5. Click **OK**. The e-mail is sent.
