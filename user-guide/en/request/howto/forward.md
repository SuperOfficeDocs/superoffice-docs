# Forward to external parties

As a request handler, you, even aided by your colleagues, are not always able to answer a request. Sometimes, you may need to ask for help from others, for example, by getting advice from a sub-supplier.

## Forward a message

1. [Open the request][1].
2. Click the **Messages** tab.
3. Click ![icon][img1] on the message you want to forward, and select **Forward**. A new message opens in edit mode.
4. Add a recipient in the **To** field. Click the **Cc/Bcc** button (on the right-hand side of the message) to add recipients on copy or blind copy.
5. [Edit the message][2].
6. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as attachments to the request.
7. Click **Send**. The message is sent.

## Forward multiple requests

In the request lists, you can forward multiple requests at the same time.

1. Select the requests you want to forward in the request list.
2. Click the ![icon][img1] menu button in the lower left corner of the request list.
3. Select **Batch management** and **Batch forward**.
4. Under **Choose recipient**, you will find the following:
    * At the top is the e-mail address of the owner of the request and other request handlers who are or have been linked to the request.
    * In the next empty field, you can enter an e-mail address if you want to forward the message to someone who has not already been registered in the system.
5. Check the recipient(s) you want, and click **To**, **Cc** or **Bcc**, depending on which recipient field you want to put them in. The recipients are displayed in the list which appears underneath.
6. If you check **Close request**, the requests are closed once they are forwarded.
7. Under **Comment**, you can enter a comment, which will then be added both to the e-mail message and to the request as an internal message.
8. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar and add any relevant documents as [attachments to the request][2].
9. Click **OK**. The requests are sent.
