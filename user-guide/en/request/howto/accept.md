# Take responsibility for requests

This is particularly relevant for unassigned requests (those without a defined owner). If you want to take over a request, it is important to follow the procedure below to identify that you have taken it over. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time.

1. [Open the request][1].
2. Accept:

    * Click the ![icon][img1] **Actions** button and select **Accept request**. Or,
    * In the **Owner** field, select yourself.

## What would you like to do now?

* [Reply to a customer][2])
* [Ask another request handler for help][3]
* [Forward messages to external parties][4]
