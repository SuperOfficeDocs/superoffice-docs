# Requests

**Requests** is the main feature of SuperOffice Service. This is where you manage requests and enquiries that are in the system. You can also create internal and external requests, respond to incoming enquiries and obtain an overview of the statuses of all requests in the system. When you open SuperOffice Service or click ![icon][img1] **Dashboard** in the Navigator, you arrive at the [Dashboard][1], which provides an overview of request handling. Click ![icon][img2] **Requests** to show relevant options for requests.

## Request header

The header of the request contains the properties defined when the [request was created][4]. The header consists of the request title, request ID, contact and deadline. In addition, you can click ![icon][img3] to set the request as a favourite ![icon][img4]. The request will then be accessible via **My favourites** under **Requests** in the Navigator, and in the **My favourites** tile on the dashboard.

## Message types

There are basically three types of messages:

* Enquiries from customers or other external parties
* Replies to these enquiries, possibly with a request for more details
* Internal notes about the request, such as questions to a colleague

> [!TIP]
> Internal messages are marked with ![icon][img5].
