# Delete priority

You cannot delete priorities, but you can set the status of a priority to **Deleted**, to make it unavailable to users and customers.

> [!TIP]
> To show deleted/inactive priorities, click the **Show deleted items** check box below the list of priorities.

## Delete a priority in Settings and maintenance

1. Go to the **Priorities** screen: Click the **Requests** button in the navigator. Then select the **Priorities** tab.

1. Click the required priority.

1. Click the **Deleted** check box.

1. Click **Save**. The priority will then no longer be available, for example, when users create new requests.

## Delete a priority in Service

1. Go to the **Priorities** screen: Select ![icon][img1] > **Priorities**.

1. Click the required priority.

1. In the **Properties** tab, select **Deleted** from the **Status** list.

1. Click **OK**. The priority will then no longer be available, for example, when users create new requests.
