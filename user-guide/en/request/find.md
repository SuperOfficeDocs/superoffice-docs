# Find a request

Do one of the following:

* Use lists, which are actually predefined searches.
* Use the search screen for requests.
* Use the [quick search][3] in the top right corner.

> [!TIP]
> Learn about [search in SuperOffice Service][4] in general.

## <a id="list" />Use lists

The simplest way to search for requests is to use the predefined searches available as menu options under **Requests** in the Navigator:

* **Last search**: Repeats the last request search you performed.

* **Last requests**: Shows the requests most recently recorded in the system. If specified in user preferences, this list will only contain requests from the categories you are a member of.

    <details><summary>How?</summary>
    To specify that only requests from categories you are a member of are displayed:

    1. Select ![icon][img2] **Personal settings** > **Settings**.
    2. Select the **Preferences** tab.
    3. Check **Show only own categories**.
    4. Click **OK**.
    </details>

* **Own open requests**: Shows requests that belong to you and which have the **Open** status. This list contains the requests that you are responsible for, and is therefore the screen you will be working in most often.

* **Get next request in queue**: If the queue system is set up for your company, you can click this option to get the next unassigned request in the queue for the category you belong to. [How to set up Get next request in queue][5].

* **Unassigned requests**: Lists requests that no-one is assigned responsibility for. To [take responsibility for one of the requests][6], it is important you do so by clicking **Accept request**. Otherwise there is a risk of others answering the request at the same time.

### Customize search criteria

In practice, all these lists are predefined searches, and if you wish you can customize the search criteria:

1. Click **Show criteria** at the top of the screen.
2. [Adjust the criteria][4].
3. Click **Search** to begin the search using the new search criteria.

> [!TIP]
> To restore the default settings, click the ![icon][img1] menu button and select **Restore default**.

## <a id="search" />Search for requests

If you are looking for a request in the system and cannot find it using the predefined searches, try this:

1. Select **Requests > Find requests**. This takes you to the **Criteria** screen.

2. Enter the required [search criteria][4].

3. Click **Search**.

4. Under **Find requests** are the requests that match your search criteria. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the preview screen on the right. If you select one of the requests in the list, its contents are displayed in the [preview section](#preview).

## <a id="category" />Search in categories

From the **Categories** screen, it is also possible to search for requests in a specific [category][7].

1. Select ![icon][img2] **System settings** > **Categories**.

2. Point at the category that you want to search, to make the icons appear to the right.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the category is a subcategory, first click the plus sign to the left of the parent category to display the associated subcategories.

3. Click **Search** next to the category name. This takes you to the search screen.

4. Continue as described above.

## Search in request log

Under **Requests** in the Navigator is the **Search in request log** option. This is a shortcut to a special search. By searching in the request log, you can find requests that were amended/updated in a specific way within a specific period.

For example, you can find all requests that you changed in the last week, regardless of who is responsible for the request or what status it has. In this way, you can easily retrieve all the requests you worked on and which you want to keep a check on in future. In other respects, this screen works like an ordinary search

## View search results for requests

Once you have a list of requests using one of the methods above, you will be in a screen containing the following sections:

* **Result**: This contains all the requests that match your search criteria.

* **Preview**: Displays the contents of the request selected under **Find requests**.

### <a id="result" />Result

Contains a list of requests that match the criteria specified above. Here you can:

* Sort the requests by clicking the appropriate column heading.
* Select a row to display the content of that request in the preview section.
* [Open a request][3] by double-clicking the relevant row.
* Click the ![icon][img1] menu button in the top right corner to access the change the view options.

> [!TIP]
> The status **Open** together with the **Read** column will give an overview if the request were **Read by owner**, **New information** or **Not read by owner**.

Under the list, you can click the ![icon][img1] menu button to access the following options:

* **Export**: Click here to export the list under **Result** to a file. You can choose from these formats: Excel, HTML and plain text.

* **Batch management**: If you select one or more requests in the list, you can click this button and select an action to perform on all the selected requests simultaneously. For example, you can choose to [add the same message to multiple requests][4], [forward multiple requests][5] or delete several requests in a single operation.

### Preview

This section of the screen displays the contents of the request selected under **Result**. You have the same options as when [processing requests][6].

If the preview section is not visible, click the ![icon][img1] menu button in the top right corner and select **Show reading pane to the right** or **Show reading pane below**.
