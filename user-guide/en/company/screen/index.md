# The Company screen

[!include[Intro](../includes/company-screen-intro.md)]

In the **Company** screen, every record in the database is displayed like an index card. A record in a database contains all the information that has been entered for a company.

To move backwards and forwards between companies, click the previous/next buttons (![icon][img2] ![icon][img1]) at the bottom right of the cards.

You can search for specific companies based on criteria that you specify. You can also write documents, generate follow-ups and create new companies and contacts.

## Section tabs in the Company screen

The **Company** screen contains the following section tabs:

| Section tab | Description |
