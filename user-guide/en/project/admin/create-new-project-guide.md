# Create a new project guide

In Settings and maintenance, you define which project types are to be assigned a project guide and which statuses and activities the project guides are to contain. What a project guide looks like can therefore vary, but below is an example of how a project using a project guide may appear.

For example, you might have a project type named **Conference**. This project type may be linked to a project guide containing the following statuses, follow-ups and documents:

| Statuses | Follow-ups | Documents |
|---|---|---|
| Planned | Planning meeting (Meeting (Internal)) | Conference programme (Note) |
| In progress | Create list of project members (Task); Conference (Meeting (External)) | Conference invitation (Letter) |
| Closing | Evaluation meeting (Meeting (Internal)) | Evaluation report (Note) |

This procedure shows you how to create a project guide from scratch.

Before you can create the project guide itself, you need to define

* statuses to include in the project guide
* the project type (with associated statuses) that the project guide will be linked to

Once you have done that, you can start designing the [project guide](#create-guide) itself.

## <a id="create-stage" /> A. Create statuses for the project guide

A project guide must be linked to a project type, which in turn consists of several statuses. You can create statuses by following the procedure under [Add items to the Project - Status list][2].

A project guide for a project of the Conference type might, for example, comprise the "Planned", "In progress" and "Closing" statuses.

Go to the next procedure to link the statuses to a project type.

## <a id="create-type" /> B. Create a project type for the project guide

A project guide must be linked to a project type. You can create a project type by following the procedure under [Add items to the Project - Type, status list][3].

Examples of project types: "Conference", "Campaign", "Internal".

> [!NOTE]
> You need to check **This project type is linked to a guide**. You should also select at least two statuses.

Go to the next procedure to create the project guide.

## <a id="create-guide" />C. Create a project guide

Once you have created statuses and specified a project type for the project guide, you can design the project guide itself. You do this by adding follow-ups and/or documents for each status in the project guide.

Do as follows:

1. Click the **Workflow** button in the Navigator (![icon][img1]).

2. Select the **Project guide** tab.

3. In the **Project type** list, select the project type you want to create a project guide for. The statuses selected for this project type are displayed in the list above.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the project type is not set up to have a project guide, you need to click **Click here to enable guide** at the bottom of the screen. If there are no statuses defined for the project type, you need to click **Click here to add statuses** at the bottom of the screen. You can also edit the project type by clicking the **Edit** button at the top.

4. Select the required status in the list. The status's details are shown at the bottom of the screen.

5. Add one or more follow-ups for the selected status, as described under [Add a follow-up for a status](#add-a-follow-up-for-a-status) below.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You do not need to add a document for each status, but you should add at least one follow-up for each status.

6. Add one or more documents for the selected status, as described under [Add a document for a status](#add-a-document-for-a-status) below.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for each status you want to add follow-ups and documents for.

The changes are saved automatically. The project guide will now be displayed in SuperOffice CRM when a project is created with the project type selected in step B.

## Add a follow-up for a status

<details><summary>Click here for an example of a follow-up</summary>

**Project type**: Conference
**Status**: Planned
**Name** of follow-up: Planning meeting
**Purpose of this follow-up**: Hold a meeting to plan the conference and set out a conference programme.
**Follow-up type**: Meeting (Internal)
**Duration**: 1 hour
**Default text**:

Planning meeting:

\- What should the conference cover?
\- Participants?
\- Speakers?
\- Where?

</details>

**To add follow-ups to a status:**

1. Select the required project type and status as described above.

2. Click **Add** under **Suggested follow-ups in status**. The **Suggested follow-up** dialog opens.

3. Enter the name of the follow-up in the **Name** field. This should be a descriptive name for the follow-up.

4. Enter the purpose of the follow-up, in the **The purpose of this follow-up** field. This text is displayed when you hold the mouse-pointer over the follow-up in the **Project guide** section tab in SuperOffice CRM.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some of the options before are, for logical reasons, not relevant for the first follow-up in a project guide.

5. Check **Assign follow-up to project member** if you want to make it possible to assign this follow-up to one of the project participants. When the project owner creates this follow-up in SuperOffice CRM, a dialog is displayed, in which the project owner can choose one of his associates to be the owner of the follow-up.

6. Check **Milestone follow-up** if you want to define the follow-up as a milestone.

7. Select a type for the follow-up in the **Follow-up type** list.

8. In the **Start date** field, enter when the follow-up should start, as the number of days from today.

9. In the **Duration** field, specify how long the follow-up should last. The format is *0h00m*.

10. In the **Default text in follow-up** field, enter a description for the follow-up.

    > [!TIP]
    > The user can change the above information as required.

11. Click **Save**.

12. Repeat this procedure to add more follow-ups in this or other statuses.

2. Click **Add** under **Suggested documents in status**. The **Suggested document** dialog opens.
3. Enter the name of the document in the **Name** field. This should be a descriptive name for the document.
4. Enter the purpose of the document, in the **The purpose of this document** field. This text is displayed when you hold the mouse-pointer over the document in the **Project guide** section tab in SuperOffice CRM.
5. Select the required template in the **Template** field (see also [Document - Template][4]).
6. Enter the subject to be used in the document in the **Default subject** field.
7. Enter any reference in the **Our ref.** field. Here you might enter a [template variable][1] for a project number, project title or another field relating to the project.
8. Click **Save**.
9. Repeat this procedure to add more documents in this or other statuses.
