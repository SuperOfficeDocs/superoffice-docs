# Tables screen

[!include[Requirement](../../includes/req-expander-services.md)]

In the **Tables** screen in **System design** there is a list of the tables in the system. Here you can extend the SuperOffice Service by creating new tables and fields for different screens in the system.

> [!TIP]
> Extra fields can for instance be used as search criteria and columns in sales.

This screen displays both standard tables, predefined in the system and which form the basis of different screens, and extra tables, which are tables you create yourself with optional content.

> [!NOTE]
> If your company uses SuperOffice CRM, you will see a message that NetServer must be restarted every time you add new fields or tables. If Travel is activated, you will also see a message that a new Travel database must be generated.

## Table folder properties

This screen is used to edit the properties of a new or existing table folder. Table folders are used to organize your custom tables.
