# Task

Tasks are follow-ups which do not usually have a defined time or duration. They always have a date deadline, for example, they may be things you must remember to do by a certain time.

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new task by clicking **New** > **Task** on the top bar.

Tasks can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

[!include[List of Activities section tabs](../includes/list-activities-section-tabs.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify a start and end time for a task, it will be entered in the diary at the correct day and time.
