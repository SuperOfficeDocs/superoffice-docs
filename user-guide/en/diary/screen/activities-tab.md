# The Activities section tab

![ Activities section tab (Diary) -screenshot][img4]

The **Activities** section tab gives you an overview of activities and acts as a to-do list or task list. It contains, among other things, appointments and tasks that you have not yet completed and you can use it to temporarily store follow-ups that you have not yet allocated to a particular time or date.

The activities list does not change when you switch between the different tabs in the top section of the **Diary** screen.

## Columns

The activities list columns contain the following information:

* ![icon][img3] : The first column in the activities list specifies the **Completed** [status of an activity][1]. A tick in the checkbox (![icon][img2]) means that the activity is completed, while an empty box means that it is not completed.

    > [!TIP]
    > To change the **Completed** status of an activity simply click the box.

* The second column contains icons that indicate the type of activity, for example, a telephone for a call. These icons reflect the text in the **Type** column.

    [!include[Table showing icons for activities](../../includes/table-activity-icons.md)]

* The remainder of the columns in the activities list show other [information about the activity][2]. If not all the text in a field is visible, hold the mouse pointer over it to display it in a tooltip.

## View activities in the activities list

Use the checkboxes below the activities list to specify which activities are displayed. The options are **Follow-ups**, **Tasks** and **Documents**.

> [!NOTE]
> Tasks are follow-ups that do not usually have a defined time or duration.

## Open activities in the activities list

Open an activity directly from the activities list by double-clicking it. This brings up the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog, depending on the type of activity. If you double-click a document, the document itself opens.

## Move between activities in the activities list

Use the scroll arrows on the right-hand side to scroll up and down in the activities list.

To view the details of several activities from the activities list, without having to open each individual activity:

1. Go to the side panel and select the **Preview** view.
2. Click an activity in the activities list. The side panel displays a preview of the selected activity.

## Preferences

Once an activity is completed, it is removed from the activities list by the next day. By default, the **Activities** section tab displays tasks that you have not completed as of today’s date.

### Display future tasks

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings > Preferences**.
2. Select **Functions** and find the **Show days ahead** option.

    Here, you define how many days ahead you want completed activities to be visible for.
    For example, entering 7 here would display tasks for the next week.

### Remove activity from list when completed

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings > Preferences**.
2. Select **Visual effects**, and then edit the **Remove completed activities** [preference][8].

### Highlight overdue activities

If an activity is highlighted in red type, this means that its provisional date was passed. To change this setting:

1. Go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings > Preferences**.
2. Select **Functions**, and edit the **Mark overdue activities** option.
