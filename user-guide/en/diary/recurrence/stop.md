# Stop repeating follow-up

You can stop a follow-up repeating as follows:

1. Select the required follow-up in the Diary or on the **Activities** section tab in the **Company**, **Contact**, **Diary**, **Sale** or **Project** screens. The **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog appears.

2. Select the **Details** tab.

3. Click the link to the right of the **Recurrence** text.

4. In the **Repeating follow-ups** dialog, click **Stop repeating** at the bottom left of the dialog.

    The **Repeating follow-ups** dialog closes.

5. Click **Save** to save the changes, or click **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving the changes.

When you stop the repeating follow-up, all instances of the follow-up *after* the one you edited are deleted. If the follow-up is the first in a series of repeating follow-ups, the repeating pattern is deleted and it will become an "ordinary" follow-up.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also stop a repeating follow-up by selecting it in the diary and deleting it. When you delete a repeating follow-up, the **Delete** dialog appears. Here you have two options: Select **Delete only this instance** if you want to delete the follow-up only for this time slot, or select **Delete all future instances including this one** if you want to delete this one and all future ones.
