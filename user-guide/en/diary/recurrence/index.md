# Repeating follow-ups

The options available for each frequency vary.

| Every workday (Mon-Fri) | Specifies that the follow-up will be repeated at the same time on each working day. |
| Every weekday (Mon-Sun) | Specifies that the follow-up will be repeated at the same time on each day of the week, including the weekend. |
| Every &lt;number&gt; day(s) | Here you enter a number to specify how many days should pass between each meeting, e.g. Every 6 days. |

## Weekly
