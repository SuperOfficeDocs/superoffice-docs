# Create appointment

There are many ways to create an appointment. Regardless of which method you use, the **Appointment** dialog opens and this is where you specify the [appointment details][2].

## Create appointment from anywhere in SuperOffice CRM

* Choose **New** > **Appointment** on the [top bar][3].

* Click the **Task** button (![icon][img1])) in the contact card, and select **Request a meeting**.

* Click the **Add** button in the **Activities** section tab.

## Create appointment from the Diary screen

* Click the **Add** button on the section tabs.

* Click the time at which you want the follow-up to start and hold the mouse button down while you drag the mouse to the required end time for the task. A blue area is displayed while you define the time slot; the follow-ups dialog then opens.

* Double-click a time in the Diary. The follow-ups dialog is displayed with a default duration for the follow-up.

* Right-click a time in the Diary and select **New**. The follow-ups dialog is displayed with a default duration for the follow-up.

* Double-click an empty line in the **Activities** section tab at the bottom of the **Diary** screen. The follow-ups dialog opens.

* Click **New** in the top bar and cliselect **Appointment**, **Phone Call** or **Task**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create the appointment from the **View** tab (see [The View tab][1]), you can choose to have the **Participants** dialog automatically filled out with the members of the view. To set this option, go to ![icon][img2] **Personal settings > Preferences > Functions** and set the **Participants from group view** preference to **Yes**. Click **Save**.
