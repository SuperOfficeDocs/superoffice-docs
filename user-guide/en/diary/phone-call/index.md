# Phone Call

Calls are follow-ups with a default duration of 15 minutes. The default start time is the current time and the date is today’s date. You can set up a call follow-up if, for example, you want to enter an outgoing phone call.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the default duration to something other than 15 minutes. Select ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Default values** > **Duration of a new phone call** and [enter the required value][4].

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new phone call by selecting **New** > **Phone Call** on the top bar.

Phone calls can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:
