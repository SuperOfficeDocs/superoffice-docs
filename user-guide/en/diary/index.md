# Diary

The diary in SuperOffice CRM is used much like a filofax and has separate pages for every day, week and month.

The diary is a useful tool when you want to plan and perform different types of tasks. From the diary, you can view, edit and delete [activities][16].

You also get a [list of sales][13] to work on, using the **Sales** section tab in the **Diary** screen.

## Work with follow-ups

In SuperOffice CRM, follow-up is a collective term for the [appointment][1], [task][2], and [phone call][3] activities. These all function in largely the same way.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to understand the distinction between activities and follow-ups (appointments, tasks and phone calls).
When you create follow-ups from the **Diary** screen, by default they are defined as appointments. However, you can change the follow-up type to task or phone call in the type field in the **Appointment** dialog. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)]

Follow-ups are closely linked to the **Diary** screen, and some functions apply especially to the Diary.

> [!TIP]
> In SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can define that all follow-ups of a specific type will be displayed in the **Diary** screen in SuperOffice CRM with the same background colour.
