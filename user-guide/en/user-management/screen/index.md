# Users screen

In the **Users** screen you can add and edit different types of users.

[**Our companies**:][2] For a person to be registered as a SuperOffice CRM user, this person must be registered with a company displayed in the **Company** list box in the **Users** screen. And for a company to be displayed in the **Company** list box in the **Users** screen, the company must appear on the company list in the **Our companies** tab.

* In the **User licences** tab, you can see how many user licences are in use, and which users are using the various licences.

* In the **User groups** tab, you can see which users belong to the different user groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes you make in the **Users** screen do not come into effect until you click **Save** at the bottom of the screen, and confirm that you want to save the changes in the dialog that then appears. If you click **Cancel**, you will lose all changes you have made in this screen since your last save.
