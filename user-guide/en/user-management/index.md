# Users

## User types

* **Associates**: SuperOffice CRM users (in your company)

* **Other users**: <!-- onsite--> Anonymous users and system users

* **Anonymous users**: Users with limited rights defined by the [role for anonymous users][4]. Anonymous users can be used, for instance, to provide access to web pages. In this way, salespersons can make relevant information from SuperOffice CRM available on a website that does not require a login, to give customers easy access to it.

* **System users**: [!include[Access rights](includes/def-system-user.md)]

    The system user is intended for integration and can be used to allow processes full access to the SuperOffice database for replicating diaries, for example.

## Associates

**Associates** are SuperOffice users in your company (or a related company such as a subsidiary).

In the **Associates** tab in the **Users** screen, you can add users of the type **Associate**, and assign them roles, groups and licenses, edit existing users and delete users.

For a person to be registered as a SuperOffice CRM user, this person must be registered with a company displayed in the **Company** list box in the **Users** screen. And for a company to be displayed in the **Company** list box in the **Users** screen, the company must appear on the company list in the **Our companies** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> In the **Users** screen you specify which licenses you want different users to have. If you want to add new system licenses or increase/reduce the number of licenses for one or more modules, contact SuperOffice to [update the license information][6].
