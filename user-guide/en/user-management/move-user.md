# Move users

You can move a user from one company to another, if your organization consists of multiple companies registered in the [Our companies][2] tab. If a user has been set up under the wrong company, or if they have changed positions/jobs within your organization, they can be moved, including their activities and sales.

To move a user:

1. [!include[Click Users](includes/goto-users.md)]

1. Select the **Associates** tab.

1. [!include[Select user](includes/select-user.md)]

    The user's information is displayed in the preview section on the right.

1. Click **Task** and select **Move user**. The **Move user** dialog opens.

1. Select **Move to** and choose the company you want to move the contact to.

[!include[Select action](../includes/select-action-on-activity.md)]

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD046 -->
    [!include[Preview results](../../includes/note-preview-results.md)]

1. Click **Move**. The user is moved to the specified company.
