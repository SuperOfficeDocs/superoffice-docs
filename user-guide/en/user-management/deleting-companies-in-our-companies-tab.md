# Delete companies in the Our companies tab

To delete companies in the **Our companies** tab, the following two criteria must be satisfied:

* The company must not have any associates registered. The number of associates is displayed in the **Associates** column in the company list. To delete a company, you must first delete the registered associates. Associates are deleted in the **Users** screen. For more details, see [Delete users][1].

* The company cannot be an active satellite. If it is defined as a satellite, this is displayed in the **Active satellite** column in the company list.

If these two criteria are met, you can delete companies as follows:

1. Open the **Users** screen.
2. Select the **Our companies** tab.
3. Select the required company in the list.
4. Click the **Delete** button below the company list. The company is removed from the list.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot delete the company if it is registered as a database owner. If you select a database owner, the **Delete** button is disabled.
