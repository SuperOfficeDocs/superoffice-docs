# Manage external users ![icon](../../media/OnPremises.png)

If you have been assigned the **Allow administration of external users** right in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance, you can add and remove external users in SuperOffice CRM in connection with Audience or third-party applications. External users can also be administrated in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance. For more information about this, see the SuperOffice Settings and maintenance help.

## To open the External users dialog:

1. Go to the company card for the company you want to manage external users for.  
    <!-- Fix reuse ID=a2 -->
    There are several ways to open the **Company** screen:

    * By clicking the **Company** button in the Navigator.
    * By using the history list (see <a href="../chap01/Using-the-history-list.md" style="background-color: Transparent;">The History list</a>) or FastSearcher (see [FastSearcher](../chap01/Using-FastSearcher.md)).
    * By double-clicking on a company in a search result or in a selection.
2. Click ![icon](../../media/btn-Menu.png)**Task** &gt; **External users**. The **External users** dialog appears.

Follow one of the procedures below:

[Add an external user](#Legge-til-en-ekstern-bruker)

[Remove an external user](#Fjerne-en-ekstern-bruker)

[Remove login for an external user](#Fjerne-p-logging-for-en-ekstern-bruker)

[Filter the list](#Filtrere-listen)

## Add an external user

1. Select the required contact in the list, and click **Edit**.
2. In the dialog which appears, enter the required user ID, password and role. You can also specify whether the login should be enabled or not, which means:
    * **Active login**: If the user has an active login, he is registered as an external user and can log in to the system.
    * **Inactive login**: If the user has an inactive login, he is registered as an external user but cannot log in to the system.
3. Click **Save** to save the settings and close the dialog, or **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving the settings.

## Remove an external user

Select in the list the contact you want to remove and click **Remove as external user**. The contact is then removed from the list of users.

## Remove login for an external user

Select the contact you want to remove the login for and click **Remove login**. The person will then remain as an external user, but the login will be disabled and he/she will not be able to log in to the system.

## 

## Filter the list

Using the **Show** list box at the bottom right of the dialog, you can filter the list of contacts according to user status.
