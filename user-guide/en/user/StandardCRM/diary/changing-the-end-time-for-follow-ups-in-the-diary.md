# Change the end time for follow-ups in the Diary

[!include[Note](../../includes/note-edit-followup.md)]

In the **Diary** screen, you can change the end time for a follow-up without having to open it:

1. Click the follow-up in the **Day** tab, **Week** tab or **View** tab.
2. Position the mouse pointer on the bottom border of the follow-up. The pointer changes into a double arrows.
3. Click the border and hold down the mouse button, while dragging the blue line up or down to decrease or increase the time slot for the follow-up. You can see the end time for the follow up in the top of the blue area.
4. Release the mouse button. The time slot for the follow-up is changed.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also change the time slot by opening the follow-up (see [Open follow-ups in the Diary](Opening-follow-ups-via-the-Diary.md)) and changing the **Start**, **End**, **Due** or **Duration** fields. These fields are described in [The Dialog for follow-ups](Dialog-for-followups.md).
