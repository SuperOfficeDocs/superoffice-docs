# Add links from the dialog for follow-ups or the Document dialog

When you are in the dialog for follow-ups or the **Document** dialog, you can add links to relevant activities, projects or sales. For example, if you are going to a meeting with a company you have previously communicated with, you can add links to documents and sales you have already created for this company.

## Add activities and sales

1. Open the **Appointment**, **Task**, **Phone Call** or **Document** dialog and enter the required information. [!include[See Appointment dialog](../../includes/see-apt-dialog.md)]. Or [The Sale dialog](Document-dialog.md).
2. Open the **Links** tab and click **Add link** at the bottom of the tab.
3. Select one of the available options.
4. Select a record from the list or start typing the name of a record to search. If you selected the **URL** option, you need to enter the link manually.
5. Click **OK**. You are then returned to the **Links** tab in the **Appointment**, **Task**, **Phone Call** or **Document** dialog, with the selected record shown in the list of links.

## Open linked activities

To see more details of a linked document, follow-up or sale, select the row in question and click **Open**. You can also double-click it.

## Remove linked activities

To remove the link to a document, follow-up or sale, select the row in question and click **Delete**.
