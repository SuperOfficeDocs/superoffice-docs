# View documents

To display the contents of a document in the knowledge base:

1. Select **Knowledge Base** &gt; **Documents**. This takes you to the **Documents** screen. The documents are in a folder structure that you can create yourself. See [Administrate folders of documents][1].
2. Go to the required folder.
3. Do one of the following:
    * Click the document name to go to the **Document properties** screen. Here you can also view and edit the contents of certain document types, such as html, txt and the native ejr format.
    * Click ![icon][img1] **Download** to download documents which cannot be viewed in the browser, such as PDF, Word and Excel files. An icon in the document list indicates the document type.
