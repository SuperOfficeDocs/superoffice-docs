# View chat statistics

In the **Dashboard** tab in the **Chat** screen you can view chat statistics.

In addition to general statistics about chat sessions, you can monitor the following:

* How many people are waiting for an agent to respond.
* How long they have waited.
* How many agents are available.
* How many chat sessions are active.

By default statistics are shown for all available channels, but you can select a specific chat channel from the **Channel** list.

## Respond to an incoming chat

Double-click a row in the Incoming chat list to respond to that chat. The chat opens in the **Chats** tab. See [Respond to a chat](chat-respond.md).

## Listen to an ongoing chat

Double-click a row in the **Ongoing chat sessions** list to listen in on (watch) an ongoing chat. The agent will not be notified that you are monitoring to the chat. You cannot participate in the chat.
