# Edit reply templates

Editing a reply template can mean one of two things:

* When using reply templates in connection with request handling (see [Add reply templates to messages](addReplyTemplatesToMessages.md)), you are free to edit the content of the message before you send it to the customer.
* From **Knowledge Base**, you can edit the properties specified when creating the reply template, including amending the reply template text. This type of editing is described below.

To edit a reply template in **Knowledge Base**:

1. Select **Knowledge Base &gt; Reply templates**.
2. Go to the folder where the reply template is located.
3. Click the reply template. This takes you to the **View reply templates** screen.
4. Click the **Edit reply template** button. This takes you to the **Reply template properties** screen.
5. Make the required changes to the properties. For more information about the fields in this screen, see [Create reply templates](newReplyTemplate.md).
6. Click **OK**. The changes are saved.
