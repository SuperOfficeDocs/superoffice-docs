# Add favorite

The Favorites function gives you easy to access to your favorite mailings or forms.

## Add a mailing as a favorite

To add a mailing or form to your favorites, open it and click the star icon ![icon][img1] in the top-right corner. The star turns yellow ![icon][img2], and the create-mailing/form is instantly added to your favorites.

In SuperOffice Service you can now quickly access the record by clicking **Marketing** and then ![icon][img3] in the Navigator.

> [!TIP]

## Remove a mailing or form from the favorites list

1. Open the mailing or form.
2. Click the favorites icon ![icon][img2] in the header. The icon changes to ![icon][img1].
