# Drag and drop editor

![Drag and drop editor -screenshot][img1]

In the **Content** step you can edit the appearance and content of the message.

* You can [insert text and images][1] (and other content) in the columns and rows of the message.

* You can define format/layout (such as font type and size, colors and margins) at global level (the whole message) or by individual sections.

* You can easily drag and drop content from the side-panel (menus, buttons, SoMe links, html content, and header and footer blocks).

SuperOffice Marketing is supplied with many [ready-made message templates][2]), and you can easily move content around to get the appearance you want. Save frequently used content as blocks to save time.

> [!TIP]
> We normally recommend a maximum width of 600 pixels for mailings. You can also check what the mailing will look like, on smart phones for example, by clicking **Mobile** (![icon][img4]) in the menu in the lower left corner. See also [Customize the message for display on mobile devices][3].

## Edit columns and blocks/sections

When you click a section (such as column, content box, row), buttons with editing options appears. The side-panel displays editing options for the selected section.

A blue frame is shown around the selected element, so that you always know which part of the message you are editing.

If you click text content, a text editing toolbar is displayed.

The global menu is always displayed at the bottom left of the content area.

See [Edit content][5].

## Edit text and images

[Edit text][5], [insert images][6] and add other content by clicking a section in the message. Use the text editing toolbar and the side-panel to edit the selected section.

## Insert new content

In the side-panel, you can drag and drop elements from the **Content** section to the message. You can also click **+** over or under a row to insert a new row.

## Move, copy and delete content

You can select a section and use the buttons to move ( ![icon][img6] ), duplicate ( ![icon][img8] ) and delete ( ![icon][img7] ) it.

## Edit format and layout

The appearance and properties of the message (such as font type and size, colors and margins) can be defined at global level (the whole message) or by section (as described above).

To edit the message at a global level, select **Body** (![icon][img12])in the side-panel.

> [!TIP]
> Use standard fonts for the best legibility with any email client or web browser.
