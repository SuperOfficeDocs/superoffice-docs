# Customise the message for display on mobile devices

Click **Toggle showing for mobile devices** ( ![icon][img1] ) in the global menu to see what the appearance is like on a smart phone. The message is automatically customised for display on smaller screens.

* Paragraphs are placed in one column.
* Paragraphs can be removed.
* Font size is increased so that the reader does not have to zoom.

You can adjust the font size by clicking **Edit top-level column** ( ![icon][img2] ) in the global menu and change the font size for **Default heading/body font for mobile devices** (as a rule of thumb, double the font size). These options are also available on the column menu.

You can also define display alternatives for mobile devices at paragraph level. Click the **Edit paragraph** button ( ![icon][img2] ) to access the **Image** and **Layout** tabs. Here you can find several options for displaying the e-mail on mobile devices.
