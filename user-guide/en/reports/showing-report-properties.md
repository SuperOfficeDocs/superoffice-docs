2. Click one of the tabs to display the reports you want.

    * [Favorite reports][5]
    * [Standard reports][1]

    > [!TIP]
    > You can go directly to a specific tab in the **Reports** screen by clicking the word **Reports** next to the **Reports** button in the Navigator and then selecting from the list.

3. Select the required report from the report list in the top left of the window. Note that:

    * The field on the right of the report list displays a description of the selected report.
    * The field at the bottom displays a list of the criteria that the report uses. These are described under [Search criteria for reports][2]. (See also [Criteria list][3].)
