# Use the Filter function in the Reports screen

You will find the **Filter** button ( ![icon][img1] ) under the report archive (the **Documents** section tab).

To filter out the information displayed in the report archive:

1. [!include[How to-goto-reports](includes/goto-reports.md)]

2. Click the **Filter** button ( ![icon][img1] ).

3. In the **From** box, specify from how far back in time you want to show reports.

4. In the **To** box, specify for how far ahead in time you want to show reports.

    > [!TIP]
    > Click the arrow next to the **To** box to open a list of possible time intervals. Using this list you can choose, for example, to show all reports defined for the next year, starting with the **From** date.

5. You now have the following options:

    * To show the reports for a specific group, select the required group in the **Groups** list. The members in the group will then be selected for you on the **Associates** list on the right.

    * To show reports for one or more associates, simply select the required people in the **Associates** list. To select several at once, hold down the **CTRL** key as you select the people you want.

    * To show your own reports, click the **Mine** button.

    * To show all reports for all groups and associates, click the **All** button.

6. When you have chosen a time interval, group(s) and associate(s), click **OK**. The report archive now shows all reports which match the criteria specified in the **Filter** dialog.
