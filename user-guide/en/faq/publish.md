# Publish FAQ entries

When a request handler [creates a suggestion for an FAQ entry][1], it will be unpublished and unavailable in SuperOffice Customer Centre. To make it available, it needs to be published. This is done by a person who has FAQ administration rights.

1. When you log in, any unpublished FAQ entries are shown on the **Status** tile on the dashboard, under **Unpublished FAQ entries**.
2. Click on the required entry.
3. In the **FAQ entry** screen, click **Edit entry**.
4. In the **FAQ entry properties** screen, select the **Question** and **Answer** tabs, and read through the question and answer.
5. If required, edit the question and answer to make them suitable for an FAQ entry and hence reusable.
6. Select the **Properties** tab.
7. Publish the FAQ entry by selecting **Published** in the **Workflow** field.
8. Make any other required changes in the **Properties** tab.
9. Click **OK**. The FAQ entry is now available for use.
