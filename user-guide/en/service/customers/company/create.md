# Create companies

Contacts can be linked to companies:

* The system searches for the domain name registered for the company, so that all contacts with this domain in their email address are automatically linked to the company.
* You can specify contacts' links to companies manually when you create them. See [Create contacts][1].

But you first need to register a company.

1. Select **Customers** > **New company**. This takes you to the **Company properties** screen.

2. Enter the company name and a department name (if applicable).

3. Enter the phone number, fax number and address including country.

4. In the **Main contact** list box, select who should be the main contact for the company.

5. In the **Priority** list box, select the default [priority][2] to apply to new requests linked to this company. This setting will be overridden if a different priority is linked to the contact for a new request. Here you can choose between **Low**, **Medium** and **High** or any custom options.

6. In the **Our service contact** field, select the person who will handle service requests for this company.

7. In the **Our contact** list box, select the request handler who will be responsible for this company.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you want to specify you yourself as the request handler responsible, simply click the person icon next to the **Our contact** list box ( ![icon][img3] ).

8. Click the **Category** list box, select the applicable category for the company. This list is maintained in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

9. Click the **Business** list box, select the applicable business for the company. This list is maintained in SuperOffice Settings and maintenance.

10. In the **Add domain** field, enter the company's Internet domain, for example, "company.com". You can add multiple domains by clicking the ![icon][img1] add button for each domain you want to add. These domains are used in particular to link contacts to companies automatically.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can delete a domain by clicking **Delete** ( ![icon][img2] ) to the right of the row.

11. Check **Link existing customers based on email address** if you want to check existing contacts against the domains you have entered. If there are any contacts with email addresses that contain this domain name and that are not already linked to another company, they will be automatically linked to the company.

12. In the **Notes** field, you can add any additional information about the company.

13. Click **OK**. The company is saved.
