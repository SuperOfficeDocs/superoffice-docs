# Send email to a contact

You can prepare an email from both the **Contact** screen and the **Company** screen. Then, the steps to send the email are the same.

## Create email from Contact screen

[!include[Go to Contact screen](../includes/goto-contact.md)]

1. Do one of the following:
    * Click the email address in the **Contact** tab. If the contact has more than one email address, you must select which one to use.
    * Click **New** on the top bar and select **Email**.
    * Click the **Task** button ( ![icon][img1] ) and select **Send email**.

    A message to the specified recipient is then opened in your default email program.
1. Write the email.
1. Go to (#send) below.

## Create email from Company screen

1. [!include[Go to company](../includes/goto-company.md)]

1. Select the **Contacts** section tab.

1. Select one or more contacts.

1. Right-click and select **Send email**. A message to the specified recipient(s) is then opened in your default email program.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only contacts with email addresses are displayed in the **To** field. Contacts without email addresses are omitted.

## Send

1. Send the email by clicking one of the following buttons:

    * **Send:** The email is sent and available in the Activities section tab.
    * **Send and archive:** The email is sent and saved as a document.
