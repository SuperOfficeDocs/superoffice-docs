# Edit privacy settings for a contact

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires functional rights. If you do not have the proper functional rights, you can only set **E-marketing** to on or off.

[!include[Need concent](../includes/why-consent.md)]

This topic explains how you set the legal basis and source for the purposes called **Sales and service** and **E-marketing**. Additional purposes might also be available in your system.

> [!TIP]
> To edit these settings for multiple contacts, use [Bulk update][2].

## Definitions

* **Consent**: You must get the permission from a person to store and process their personal data.

* **Purpose**: Why you are storing and processing a person's data. Examples: **Sales and service** and ***E-marketing**. For each purpose you must document the following:

  * **Legal basis**: The legal basis for storing and processing a person's data.
  * **Source**: How and where you obtained the person's consent.

## How to edit the privacy settings for a contact

1. Go to the contact in the **Contact** screen.
    At the bottom of the contact card, you can see whether a legal basis has been set for the purpose **Sales and service**.

2. Click **Legal basis** at the bottom of the contact card. The **Privacy** dialog opens. This dialog contains a list of purposes:
    * **Sales and service**: This purpose *must* have a legal basis and source, since you need a person's consent to lawfully process and store their personal data in SuperOffice.
    * **E-marketing**: You need a person's permission to send them e-marketing material. This purpose can also be set by using the **E-marketing** button in the **Interests** tab.
    * Additional purposes can be added from Settings and maintenance.

3. Double-click a purpose where the **Legal basis** and **Source** columns are empty. The **Edit legal basis** dialog opens.

4. In the **Legal basis** list, select the applicable legal basis. Example: If the person has signed a service agreement, you can select **Contract**.

5. In the **Source** list, select how consent was given by the person.
6. Add an additional comment in the **Comment** field, for example if the source is unknown.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 to edit another purpose.
9. Click **Close** when you are done.
