# Send a quote

Once you have added products to the quote and created a quote document, you can send the quote to the customer.

1. Open the quote in question.
2. Click **Send**. The **Publish/send a quote** dialog appears.

    <details><summary>Is an error message displayed?</summary>

    You cannot send a quote if it [needs to be approved][1]) or [contains errors or warnings][2]).
    </details>

3. If required, edit the validity of the quote in the **Valid to** field. The number of days until the quote expires is shown on the right of the field.

4. Select the required template for the quote in the **Quote layout** field.

5. Click in the **Language** field to choose which language to send the quote in.

6. If your quote contains alternatives, you can select **Use favourite alternative only** to include only this alternative. Otherwise all alternatives will be included in the quote.

7. In the **Publish** field, choose one of the following:
    * **Send as email and archive as PDF**. You have to choose an email template in the list.
    * **Archive as PDF only**. You have to send the quote to the customer yourself.

8. Check **Follow-up** if, for example, you want to create a reminder to yourself to follow up the quote. Select the date for the follow-up, and enter a follow-up text.

9. Click **Preview** to view a PDF version of the quote before you send it.

10. Click **OK** when you have finished. If you opted to send the quote via email, the **New email** dialog appears. Here you can edit the text and send the quote to the customer. If the archive option is on, the **Document** dialog opens.

The quote is marked as **Sent** and is archived as a PDF document in the **Activities** section tab.
