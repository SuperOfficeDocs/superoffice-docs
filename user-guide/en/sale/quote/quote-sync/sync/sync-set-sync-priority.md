# Set Sync Priority

If SuperOffice is connected to several ERP system, and there are several Sync Connectors and ERP connections active simultaneously, you should assess which ERP connections should have priority if there is a lot of data traffic. In the **Set Sync Priority** dialog, you can specify the order of priority for the ERP connections.

1. Go to the **Sync** tab in the **Quote/Sync** screen.
2. Click **Set Sync Priority** at the bottom of the **ERP connections** list. The **Set Sync Priority** dialog opens.
3. Select an ERP connection that you want to set the sync priority for.
4. Click the ![icon][img1] ![icon][img2] arrows at the bottom to set the priority.
5. Click the **Done** button when you have set the priority for the ERP connections.
