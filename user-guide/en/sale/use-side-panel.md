# How to use the side panel efficiently for sales

In the guide [Use selections to forecast your sales][3], you learn how to make a selection of your sales opportunities.

When you have selected the **Sale** screen in the **Navigator**, you can view **Sale selections** in the **Selection members** panel in the [side panel][1]. Click on any of the sales opportunities to view them inside the **Sale** screen.

By clicking through all your sales one by one, you can easily check them all to make sure you know what the current status of that sales is, and whether you have a follow-up activity in place.

If you spot a sales opportunity that is visible in red in the **Selection members** list, this means this sales opportunity has an overdue activity or sale date, and you should have a look at it.

In the same way you can use a selection of contacts as a calling list to follow up on them one by one. Or use a list of sales proposals to make sure you follow up on all outstanding proposals.

Use the side panel, and you’ll be able to work in a well-organized and efficient way.
