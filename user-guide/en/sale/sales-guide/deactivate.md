# Deactivate a sales guide

[!include[Must be admin](../../includes/req-admin.md)]

To remove a sales guide from a sale type, you can deactivate it. You do this by unchecking **This sale type is linked to a guide** for the sale type in question (see [Add items to the Sale - Sale type (for stages) list][1]).

If you subsequently want to reuse the sales guide, you can simply check this option again. Any follow-ups and documents previously added to the sales guide's stages will be automatically retrieved. You can also add new follow-ups and/or documents, or delete those you don't want to use in this sales guide.
