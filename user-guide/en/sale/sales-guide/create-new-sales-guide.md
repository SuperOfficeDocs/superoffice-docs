# Create a new sales guide

[!include[Must be admin](../../includes/req-admin.md)]

This procedure shows you how to create a sales guide from scratch.

Before you can create the sales guide itself, you need to define

* [stages](#create-stages) to include in the sales guide
* [the sales type](#create-type) (with associated stages) that the sales guide will be linked to

Once you have done that, you can start designing the [sales guide](#create-guide) itself.

## <a id="create-stages" />A. Create stages for the sales guide

A sales guide must be linked to a sale type, which in turn consists of several stages. You can create stages by following the procedure under [Add items to the Sale - Stage list][2].

A sales guide for sales to new customers might include, for example, the stages "First meeting", "Quotation" and "Signing of contract".

Go to the next procedure to link the stages to a sale type.

## <a id="create-type" />B. Create a sale type for the sales guide

A sales guide must be linked to a sale type. You can create a sale type by following the procedure under [Add items to the Sale - Type, Stages, Quote list][3].

Examples of sale types: "Sale to new customer", "Sale to existing customer", "Cross-sale to existing customer".

> [!NOTE]
> You need to check **This sale type is linked to a guide**. You should also select at least two stages.

Go to the next procedure to create the sales guide.

## <a id="create-guide" />C. Create a sales guide

Once you have created stages and specified a sale type for the sales guide, you can design the sales guide itself. You do this by adding follow-ups and/or documents for each stage of the sales guide.

Do as follows:

1. Click the **Workflow** button in the Navigator (![icon][img1]).

2. Select the **Sales guide** tab.

3. In the list at the top, select the sale type you want to create a sales guide for. The stages selected for this sale type are displayed in the list underneath.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the sale type is not set up to have a sales guide, you need to click **Click here to turn on guide** at the bottom of the screen. If there are no stages defined for the sale type, you need to click **Click here to add stages** at the bottom of the screen. You can also edit the sale type by clicking the **Edit** button at the top.

4. Select the required stage in the list. The stage's details are shown at the bottom of the screen.

5. Add one or more follow-ups for the selected stage, as described under [Add a follow-up for a stage](#add-a-follow-up-for-a-stage) below.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You do not need to add a document for each stage, but you should add at least one follow-up for each stage.

6. Add one or more documents for the selected stage, as described under [Add a document for a stage](#add-a-document-for-a-stage) below.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for each stage you want to add follow-ups and documents for.

The changes are saved automatically. The sales guide will now be displayed in SuperOffice CRM when a sale is created with the sale type selected in step B.
