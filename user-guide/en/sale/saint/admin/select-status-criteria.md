# Specify status criteria

[!include[Requirement](../includes/note-saint-req.md)]

A status is only active for companies, contacts or projects that fulfil all the criteria you have specified for the status. You need to specify one or more criteria for each status you create.

1. Select the required status in the status list on the left of the screen.

1. Click **Add** in the list in the bottom-right (under the **Description** tab and **Create follow-up** tab). A new line is added to the list.

1. Click the arrow button ( ![icon][img1] ) next to the empty field, and select the required search criterion as described under [Use search criteria][1].

1. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each criterion you want to add.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only add one instance of each criteria type for each status. For example, you cannot add the **Postcode** criterion twice.
