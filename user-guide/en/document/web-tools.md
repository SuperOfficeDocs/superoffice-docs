SuperOffice WebTools maintains the integration with your documents and e-mail. The SuperOffice WebTools download consists of two components:

* **SuperOffice WebTools** – which facilitates the integration between browsers, documents and SuperOffice applications.
* **SuperOffice Mail Link** – which gives you the possibility to archive e-mails from your Outlook or Lotus Notes e-mail client.
