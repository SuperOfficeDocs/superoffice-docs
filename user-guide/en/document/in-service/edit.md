# Edit documents

When we refer to editing documents in the context of SuperOffice Service, this can mean one of two things: editing the actual content of the document and editing the document properties.

## Edit document content

To edit the content of the document itself, for example the text in a letter, you need, in addition to SuperOffice Service, the application the document was originally created in.

> Certain document types, such as html, txt and the native ejr format, can be edited directly in the **Document properties** screen.

**Steps:**

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Documents**.
2. Go to the folder where the document is located.
3. Click ![icon][img1] **Download** to download a document.
4. Edit and save the document using the application the document was originally created in.
5. Click the document name to go to the **Document properties** screen.
6. Click the **Choose file** button next to **File**, and in the dialog that appears select the document you have edited.
7. Click **OK** to upload the document.

## Edit document properties

By editing the document's properties, you can, for example, change who is to have access to the document.

**Steps:**

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Documents**.
2. Go to the folder where the document is located.
3. Click the document name to go to the **Document properties** screen.
