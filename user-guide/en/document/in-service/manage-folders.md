# Manage document folders

Under **Knowledge Base** > **Documents** you can create a folder structure for documents, to give them a logical structure and make it easy for others to find information. You can create sub-folders in all folders, and you can place the documents in any of these folders. Find out more below about how to work with the folder structure.

## Create folders

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Documents**.
2. Go to the folder you want to create a sub-folder under. You can create it directly under the **Documents** folder or under any of its sub-folders.
3. Click the **New folder** button at the top of the screen. This takes you to the **Document folder properties** screen.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the folder in the **Name** field.
5. The **In folder** field automatically shows the name of the parent folder you chose. If you change your mind, you can click the list button ( ![icon][img1] ) and select a different folder in the list that appears.
6. In the **Access** list box, you select who is to have access to read and edit the folder.
7. Click **OK**. The new folder is created. You are now ready to [add documents][1] to the new folder.

## Delete folders

When you delete a folder, all the documents in it are also deleted from SuperOffice Service.

1. Select **Knowledge Base** > **Documents**.
2. Go to the required folder.
3. Click **Edit folder**. This takes you to the **Document folder properties** screen.
4. Click **Delete**.
5. Click **OK** to confirm. The folder and its contents are removed from SuperOffice Service.
