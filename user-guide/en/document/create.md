# Create documents

If you want to add a document to SuperOffice Service, you first need to create the document itself. To create a price list, you could, for example, use Microsoft Word or Excel to write the contents. You then add it to SuperOffice Service as follows:

1. Select **Knowledge Base** &gt; **Documents**.
2. Go to the folder you want to put the document in. If it does not yet exist, you can create a new folder. See [Administrate folders of documents][1].
3. Click the **New document** button. This takes you to the **Document properties** screen.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the document in the **Name** field.
5. The **In folder** field automatically shows the name of the folder you chose. If you change your mind, you can click the list button ( ![icon][img1] ) and select a different folder in the list that appears.
6. In the **Access** field, select who is to have access to read and edit the document.
7. If you want to use the document in a web-based customer centre, you can add a unique ID string in the **ID string** field.
8. In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of what the document contains.
9. Click the **Choose file** button next to **File**, and in the dialog that appears select the document you have created.
10. Click **Save**. If the document type can be edited in the browser, the **Contents** field is populated with the document contents.
11. Click **OK**. The document is added to the specified folder under **Documents**.
