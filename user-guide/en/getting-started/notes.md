# Taking notes

In SuperOffice CRM, you can bring up a useful little notepad, regardless of where you are in the program. You can also attach individual notes to the current company, contact, sale, project or selection card.

* To attach an important comment to something specific, such as a company, create a **Note**.

* To add a note without fastening it to any specific item in SuperOffice CRM, use the **Notepad**.

## Create a note

1. Go to the required company, contact, sale, selection or project.
2. Select the **Note** tab and click **Edit**.
3. Type in the required information on the note.
4. Click **Save**.

A dot on the **Note** tab indicates that a note has been added.

## Delete a note

To delete a note, simply delete all the text in the note. The dot disappears from the **Note** tab.

## Hide/show Notepad

At any time, you can show or hide the Notepad by:

* Clicking ![icon][img1] **Main menu** > **Show Notepad**. A tick in front of the menu option means that the option is enabled.
* Selecting **Notepad** on the [side panel][1] list of views will display the notepad in the side panel.

When you display the Notepad on the screen, you can grab the top part of the notepad window and drag it wherever you want.

## To use the Notepad

1. Position the mouse pointer in the Notepad.
2. Type in your text as required.
3. Press **TAB** to exit the Notepad, or click outside the Notepad window. The text will be saved automatically and a new Notepad page created.

> [!TIP]
> You can browse back and forth between the pages using the arrow buttons at the bottom of the Notepad. The current page number and total number of pages are displayed at the bottom of the Notepad.

If the Notepad is open when you close SuperOffice CRM, it will also be displayed when you next start the program, with all the text saved.
