# Create selections

Static and dynamic selections are created in a similar way:

1. Find the data you want to included in the selection via the **Find** screen. Choose either static or dynamic as your type and save.
2. Set the properties.
3. Optionally add the new selection to your favorites. Then save.

Step 1 is different for combined selections because you start with two existing selections instead of looking for data.

> [!TIP]
> Click ![icon][img4] on the far right of the column headers in a selection. Here you can group and filter records, and add/remove columns. These settings can be saved for the active selection by selecting **Save columns for current selection only**. See also [The section tabs][4] for additional functions.
