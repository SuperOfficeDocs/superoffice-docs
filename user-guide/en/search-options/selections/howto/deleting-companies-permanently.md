# Delete records permanently

To delete multiple records (contacts, companies, sales, projects, and so on), you can create a selection of these records and delete them in one operation.

> [!NOTE]
> This task is only available for users with administrator access. It is also a task you should think about carefully before performing, because it deletes all selected records permanently, both from the **Selection** screen and from the SuperOffice database.

1. Go to a selection. For example, [use the Find screen][1].

1. To delete just some of the selection members, select them in the list of members.

1. Click the **Task** button and select **Delete all**.
