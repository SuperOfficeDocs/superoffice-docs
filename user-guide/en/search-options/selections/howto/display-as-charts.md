# Display selections as charts

In the **Charts** tab you can click a chart type to display the data in the active selection as a chart. The available chart types depend on the selection type (only sales related charts are available for sale selections). Dynamic selections with charts can also be used in [dashboards][1].

The following features are available for charts:

* Click on a chart to drill down on the chart data.

* Place the mouse-pointer over chart sectors to view detailed source data.

* Click the data labels (legend) next to or under the chart to hide/show specific data in the charts. This can be useful for printing or saving the charts from the preview window.

* ![icon][img1]: Click here to preview a chart. Here you can also see the data source table for the chart.

* ![icon][img2]: Click here to refresh the chart with updated data.

> [!NOTE]
> Go to **Dashboard** in the navigator to view charts of ALL SuperOffice data. See [Dashboard][1].
