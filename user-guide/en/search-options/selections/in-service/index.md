# Selections

You use selections to create a set of records that you want to work with later on and in other parts of the program. The criteria for selecting these records are highly flexible. A selection could be, for example

* A list of all the requests you have completed this week (so that you can report on them)
* A list of contacts you specially want to follow up
* All open requests for specific categories

The aim is to find out how many records match the specific criteria and to follow them up in an organised way. There are several types of selections:

## Dynamic selection

[!include[Definition of dynamic selection](../includes/def-dynamic-selection.md)]

## Script-based selection

In a script-based selection, you [define a data selection using a CRMScript][1], which offers almost unlimited possibilities for advanced calculations and criteria for defining the selection.

## Static selection

A static selection is a list containing only records you added manually, in contrast to a dynamic selection. Once you have [created a static selection][2] and added records to it, it will always contain the same records until you either add or remove some. A static selection works like a report where you always have full control over the records.

## Combined selection

A combined selection is a combination of two or more existing selections. You can add records from one selection to another, or remove records in one selection from another. For example, if you want a selection containing all customers based on specific criteria (dynamic selection), but excluding individual customers (static selection).
