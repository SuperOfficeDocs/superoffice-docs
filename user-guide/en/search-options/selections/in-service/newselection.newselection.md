# Create a selection based on search criteria

The simplest way to create a selection is to base it on a search. This creates a dynamic selection. Proceed as follows:

Open the search screen.

* You can select **Requests** > **Find requests** to [search for requests][1].
* You can [use predefined lists][2] to search for requests.
* You can select **Customers** > **Find contacts** or **Find companies** to search for contacts and companies.
* In the knowledge base, you can click the **Search** icon ![icon][img1] to the right of a folder name to search for different types of content.

Enter or adjust the criteria as described under [Search in SuperOffice Service][3].

Click ![icon][img2] > **Save as selection**. The **Edit selection** screen is displayed.

In the **General info** tab, enter the following:

[!include[Contents of Selection General info tab](includes/selection-general-info.md)]

In the **Selection** tab you can view the search criteria specified for the selection. If necessary, adjust the criteria as described under [Search in SuperOffice Service][3].

In the **Profile** tab, specify how the selection is to be presented:

[!include[Contents of Selection Profile tab](includes/selection-profile-tab.md)]

Click **OK**. The selection is saved, and you are returned to the **List selections** screen. From here you can, for example, update the selection.
