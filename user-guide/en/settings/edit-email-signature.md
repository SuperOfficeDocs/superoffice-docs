# Edit email signature

> [!NOTE]
  > The default signature template contains [template variables][3] for your name, company, address, phone numbers, e-mail address, website, etc. The variables are replaced with data from your contact card, so your signature will always be updated with the correct information.

1. Click the **Personal settings** button in the Top bar.
2. Select **Edit personal signature**. This will bring up your signature dialog.
3. Select the **E-mail signature** tab or **Request signature** tab.
4. Edit the signature by deleting or adding information.
5. Click ![icon][img2] to open the text editor toolbar. Here you have various options for editing text and adding additional content.
6. Click ![icon][img3] in the toolbar to add variables, or go to [template variables][3] for the complete list of available variables.
7. Add images and links using the buttons in the toolbar. You can also drag and drop links and images. Use the **Insert link** button to add links to social media.
8. Click **Save** when you are done.
9. Optional: Test the signature by sending an e-mail to yourself or by creating a new request. Check that all information is displayed correctly, and the links work and images are displayed as intended.
