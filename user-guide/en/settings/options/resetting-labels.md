# Reset labels

If you have changed any labels and want to return to the default settings for one or more:

[!include[Go to Options](includes/open-options.md)]

1. Select the **Labels** tab.

1. Search for the label. Changed labels are displayed in bold text in the list.

1. Select the label.

1. Click **Delete translation** below the list. The label is reset to its original value.

To cancel all the label changes, uncheck **Enable label substitution**.

> [!NOTE]
> The translated labels will NOT be deleted. They are hidden in the GUI, and the default labels are displayed in their place. As soon as you enable label substitution again, the translated labels will be displayed again.
