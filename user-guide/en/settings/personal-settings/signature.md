# Signature

In the **Signature** tab, you can enter a signature that is automatically added to the messages you write. This works in the same way as when entering text into a word processor.

1. Click ![icon][img1] to open the text editor toolbar. Here you have various options for editing text and adding additional content.
2. Click ![icon][img2] in the toolbar to add variables, or go to [template variables][1] for the complete list of available variables.
3. Add images and links using the buttons in the toolbar. You can also drag and drop links and images. Use the **Insert link** button to add links to social media.
4. Click **OK** when you are done.
5. Optional: Test the signature by creating a new request. Check that all information is displayed correctly, and the links work and images are displayed as intended.
