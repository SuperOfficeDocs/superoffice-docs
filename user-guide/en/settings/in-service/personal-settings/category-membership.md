# Category membership

You use the **Category membership** tab in the **Edit users** screen to specify which categories you are a member of. If you are a member of categories via a user group (see [User information][1]), the text **(from user group)** is shown next to the category name.

## Add category to your list

1. Select ![icon][img2] **Personal Settings > Settings > Category membership** tab.
2. Click the **Category** list, and select the category you want.
3. Click **Add** to add the category, or click **Add with subcategories** to include the subcategories of the selected category.
4. Repeat steps 1-2 for each category you wish to add.
5. Click **OK**. The changes are saved.

## Delete categories

You remove a category from the list by clicking the delete icon ( ![icon][img1] ) to the right of the category in question.
