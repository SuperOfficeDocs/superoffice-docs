# Lists

The **Lists** screen contains descriptions and definitions of the lists in SuperOffice CRM. Here you can customise the predefined lists supplied with SuperOffice CRM.

[!include[Find specific list](includes/tip-find-list.md)]

You can also add your own user-defined lists which are displayed on the **More** tabs in SuperOffice CRM. You specify what is displayed in the **More** tabs in the **Fields** screen (see [Fields][10]).

The **Lists** screen is divided into the following parts:

> [!NOTE]
> User groups and headings are not displayed for lists where they are irrelevant.

* At the top of the screen, you can click the list box to choose from among all available lists in SuperOffice, both predefined and user-defined lists. See [Add user-defined lists][5].
* The **Items** tab contains the items that are available for the selected list. See [Items][1].
* The **User groups** tab shows items per user group. See [User group filtering][7].
* The **Headings** tab shows items per heading. See [Headings][1].
* In the **Visible for user groups** list, you can see the group(s) that the item selected in the **Items** list will be displayed to. You can for example choose to have different follow-up types available for your Sales, Support and Accounting user groups. See [User group filtering][7].
* The **Headings** list shows the headings under which the individual items are displayed. If a list is very long (contains a large number of items), you can use headings to group the items logically. The items in the **Document - Template** list, for example, are grouped in the **Letter**, **Fax**, **Email** headings and so on. See [Headings][1].

At the top right side is the **Use grouping and user group filtering for this list** checkbox, where you specify if the list can be grouped and filtered. This option is deactivated for lists where this is irrelevant. See [Organizing lists][3].

At the bottom of the **Lists** screen is the **Show deleted items and headings** checkbox, which allows you to undo the deletion of items and headings. See [Delete items][8] and [Deleted items and headings][9].
