# Add a sale stage

[!include[Must be admin](../../includes/req-admin.md)]

When you add an item to the **Sale - Stage** list, the **Edit list item** dialog is not the same as described under [Add items][1].

[!include[Edit list item](../../includes/edit-list-item.md)] when the list items are sale stages:

1. Enter the required name of the item in the **Name** field. This will be displayed in the option list for the **Stage** field in the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM.

    [!include[Mandatory](../../includes/note-mandatory-field.md)]

2. Specify the probability for the item by typing a percentage in the **Probability** field. This figure will be displayed next to the stage in the **Sale** screen in SuperOffice CRM, and indicates the chance of a successful sale at this stage.

3. Optionally, type in a description of the item in the **Description** field.

4. [!include[Save or cancel](../../includes/save-or-cancel.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete a stage that is linked to a sales guide (via a sale type), this may have consequences for using the sales guide.
