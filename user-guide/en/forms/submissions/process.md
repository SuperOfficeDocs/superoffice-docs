# Process form submissions

Form submissions with status **Submitted** must be processed manually. This means reviewing the form contents and linking the submitter to an existing or a new contact and/or company in SuperOffice. Processed forms will be available in the **Activities** section tab in the **Company** and **Contact** screens in SuperOffice CRM. If you have selected to be notified by new request, the processed forms will be available in the **Request** section tab.

> [!NOTE]
> SuperOffice will check and validate the e-mail address entered in the form to make sure it is an existing domain name. Basic e-mail address syntax will also be checked.

To process a submission:

1. In SuperOffice Marketing:
    1. Open a form and go to the **Form submissions** tab or go to the **Form submissions** tab (in the main **Marketing** screen).
    2. At the bottom of the list of form submission, deselect all filters except **Submitted**. The list now displays only form submission that must be processed.

    In SuperOffice CRM: Go to the **Contact** screen, search for the relevant person and select the **Activities** section tab.
2. Double-click a row. The **Form submission** window opens.
3. Review the submitted data in the **Data from form** tab.
4. Go to the **Actions** tab to view the actions that are performed on the form data when you process it.
5. In the **Submitter** side panel, you must link the submitter to an existing or new contact in SuperOffice. See the next topic on how to do this.
6. Click **Process**.

## Linking the submitter to a SuperOffice contact and company

When a form is submitted, SuperOffice will try to match the e-mail address in the form with existing e-mail addresses in SuperOffice to link the form submission to an existing contact. If the submitter is found in SuperOffice, you can show contact information, requests, sales, follow-ups and previous chat sessions that have been registered for this contact in SuperOffice.

If no match is found, you must try to locate the correct contact or create a new contact (and company).

## Use suggested contact

If SuperOffice finds matching contacts in the database, they will be listed under **This contact could be...**. Click a contact to view relevant information and to link the contact to this form submission.

## Search for a contact

If SuperOffice cannot find the correct contact in the database, you can search for the contact using the search field. Here you can also select from the history list and favourites.

## Change contact

If you have selected the wrong contact, you can click **Change contact** at the bottom of the side panel to search for another contact.

## Create new company and contact

If the submitter is not found in SuperOffice, you can create a new contact and company in the side panel.

1. Click **Create new company and contact**. Some fields have been filled in with information the customer has provided in the form.
2. Fill in the relevant fields.
3. Click **Add**. The new contact and company is added to SuperOffice.
