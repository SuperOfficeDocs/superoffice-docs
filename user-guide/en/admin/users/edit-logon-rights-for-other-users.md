# Change login rights for other users

[!include[Requirement](../includes/note-users-that-req-es.md)]

If an anonymous user or a system user is no longer to have the option of logging in to the system, you can remove their login rights. The external user will not be removed, but defined as inactive and can always be reactivated if required.

## Deactivate a user

1. [!include[Click Users](includes/goto-users.md)]
2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]
3. In the list, select the active user who you want to remove login rights for, and click **Remove login** below the list.

    This user can then no longer log in to the system.

## Activate a user

1. [!include[Click Users](includes/goto-users.md)]
2. [!include[Select Other users](includes/select-other-users.md)]
3. In the list, double-click the user you want to activate.
4. Select **Active** to the right of **Login** to activate the user.
5. Click **Save**. This user can then log in to the system.
