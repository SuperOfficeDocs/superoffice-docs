# Delete stopwords

The object of deleting stopwords is to include them in freetext searches after having excluded them. To delete a stopword from the list:

[!include[Go to freetext search tab](../includes/goto-freetext.md)]

1. Check that freetext search is enabled for SuperOffice CRM (see [Enable freetext search][1]).

1. Select the required stopword.

1. Click the **Delete** button below the stopword list.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Changes to the stopword list do not have a retroactive effect, i.e. deleted stopwords will still function as stopwords for fields that were created before you deleted them. If you want your changes to apply retroactively, you can generate a new freetext index.
