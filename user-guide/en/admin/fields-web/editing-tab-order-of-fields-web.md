# Edit the TAB order of fields

The TAB order is the order in which you move between the various fields when you press the TAB key. You can change the TAB order to reflect the logical sequence in which the users normally enter data in fields.

The TAB order is displayed in the **Name** list on the left of the screen. This order is not the same as the fields’ physical positions, which are shown in the preview field at the top right.

To edit the TAB order in one of the **More** tabs in SuperOffice CRM:

1. Open the **Fields** screen.
2. Go to the required tab: **Company, Contact, Project,** **Sale**, **Follow-up** or **Document**.
3. Select the required field below the list.
4. Click one of the arrows below the list to move the field either up ( ![icon](../media/pil-flyttopp.bmp) ) or down ( ![icon](../media/pil-flyttned.bmp) ).
5. Click **Publish** if you want the changes to be available to SuperOffice CRM users.
