# Delete/deactivate price lists or products

In the **SuperOffice products** tab in the **Quote/Sync** screen, you can delete or deactivate both price lists and products in the price lists. These price lists and products will then no longer be available when users are creating quotes.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you **deactivate** price lists and products rather than deleting them permanently. If you delete them, problems may arise when updating prices and sending quotes.

## Deactivate price lists

1. Select the price list you want to deactivate, in the **Price list** list.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Uncheck the **Active** checkbox.  
    or  
    Check **Limited validity** and specify the deactivation date in the **Valid to** field.
4. Click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> Deactivated price lists are not available when the users are creating quotes.

## Deactivate products

1. Select the price list containing the product you want to deactivate, in the **Price list** list. The products in the price list are shown in the list at the bottom.
2. Uncheck the checkbox at the far left for each product you want to deactivate.

Deactivated products are not available when the users are creating quotes.
