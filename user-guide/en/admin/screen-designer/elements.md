Labels can be used to create headings for specific groups of fields or a column.

2. Click and drag the **Label** element to the layout.
3. Click the label. The **Settings** sections opens to the left.
4. Replace the text **New label** with the new label name.
5. You can also add the label in other languages by clicking ![icon][img1] (see [Translation][2]).
6. Change the font formatting as necessary.

## Add dividers

Use dividers to create sections within columns. This is particularly useful for grouping various types of information.

1. Select the tab you want to edit.
2. Click and drag the **Divider** element to the layout.
3. Click the divider. The **Settings** sections opens to the left.
4. If relevant, change the spacer type.

## Add links

Add links for looking up information in other websites, allow users to run CRM scripts from the company and contact cards, and add navigation to other parts of SuperOffice using soprotocol. You can also use buttons to add links.

6. In the **Action** list, select the action to perform when clicking the button:

    * **Open website**: Select this option to add a link to a website. Select the URL encoding and target as necessary.
    * **Execute CRMScript**: Select this option to add a CRM script to run specific actions in SuperOffice. See [CRMScript][6].
