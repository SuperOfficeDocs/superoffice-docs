# Organizing lists

SuperOffice CRM contains many default lists with even more list items. As you add your own (user-defined) lists and list items, it is a good idea to organize your lists. There are two main ways to organize lists in SuperOffice CRM:

* Grouping: Using headings in lists to categorize list items in 2 levels. Example: The **General - Resource** list can be grouped using two headings; *Equipment* and *Rooms*. See [Group items under headings](Grouping-items-under-headings.md).
* User group filtering: Making list items visible only to the user groups who actually use them. Example: The **Document - Template** list can be filtered so that quote templates are not visible to user groups that never send quotes. See [User group filtering](User-groups.md).

In Settings and maintenance, you can specify for most predefined and all user-defined lists that they should be grouped.

> [!NOTE]
> The list must consist of a certain minimum number of items in order to be displayed in this way. This number is defined in the **Preferences** screen (see [Preferences](../preferences/index.md)).

To specify that a list should be grouped:

1. Click the **Lists** button in the Navigator (![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/Knapp-Lister-liten.bmp)).
2. Click the arrow ( ![icon](../../../media/icons/admin/pil-ned.bmp) ) and select the required list.
3. Check **Use grouping and user group filtering for this list** at the top right.

> [!NOTE]
> The grouping function is not available for some of the predefined lists (for example, the **General - User group** list). If a list cannot be grouped, this checkbox is disabled.

For more details on defining headings for grouped lists, see [Group items under headings](Grouping-items-under-headings.md).
