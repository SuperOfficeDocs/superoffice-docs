# General - Currency

In the **Sale** screen tabs in SuperOffice CRM, you specify sale amount, costs and profit for the sale. The currency that the amounts are shown in depends on what you specify in the **Preferences** screen in Settings and maintenance (see [Preferences](../preferences/index.md)), where you choose your own currency and a base currency, from a list that is defined in the **Lists** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable use of currency, go to **Preferences** &gt; **Enable use of currency**.
