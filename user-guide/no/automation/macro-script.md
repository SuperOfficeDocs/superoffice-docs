# Macros and scripts

In the **Macros and scripts** tab you will find a list of the scripts and macros in the system, grouped in folders. Click a script or macro in the list to [view, edit or run it][1].

## About macros

Macros are the user-friendly version of scripts: You don’t need extensive knowledge about scripting or CRMScript to create macros.

With macro’s you are able to customize and automate actions inside SuperOffice. It comes with an easy to use wizard that will help you setup your macro.

Macros have a number of functions in SuperOffice. They can be linked to specific [triggers][1] in the system (such as escalations or new message on request in SuperOffice Service) or be assigned to buttons in defined screens, so that users can click a button to perform a set of actions that are often repeated. This makes request management faster and users avoid unnecessary clicking.

For example, you can use macros

* As a task/function in a menu point (such as in ![icon][img1] **Actions** in the **Request** screen)
* When a request is escalated via the warning levels for priority
* As a planned task
* When they are activated by an e-mail filter
* When a recipient clicks a tracked link in a mailing

## What is the difference between a script and a macro?

A macro is a set of predefined actions executed in a specific order, and require no programming skills to set up.

A script is a small program written to perform specific tasks, and requires programming skills to set up.
