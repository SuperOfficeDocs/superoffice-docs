# Text analysis

Increase globalization by detecting and translating foreign languages in requests. Your customer support agents can select to translate message content in unfamiliar languages, from the **Requests** screen in SuperOffice Service.

* **Language detection**: Select this option to activate automatic language detection for incoming requests. The detected language will be displayed below request messages in SuperOffice Service.
* **Translate message**: Select this option to activate translation of incoming requests. Request handlers can then click a link in a message to translate it. Language detection must be activated for this function to work.

Increase customer satisfaction by using AI to detect importance/urgency and the customer's emotional language. Run automatic analysis of incoming messages in requests, to determine if the content is positive, negative or neutral.

* **Sentiment analysis**: Select this option to activate automatic sentiment analysis for incoming requests. Request handlers can quickly determine the "mood" of a message from the emoticon (happy, unhappy or neutral) below the message in a request.
