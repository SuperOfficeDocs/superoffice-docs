The Customer also accepts that statistical data about the use of SuperOffice CRM (NOT including any customer data or personal data) can be uploaded to SuperOffice servers. The purpose of this is to enable insights to user patterns that may be used by SuperOffice in order to improve our products and services.

Transformation and storage of all collected data is done in accordance with SuperOffice Security and Privacy Statement.
