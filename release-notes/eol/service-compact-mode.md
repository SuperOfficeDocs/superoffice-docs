# End of life - SuperOffice Service CompactMode

This is a formal announcement of End of Life for our SuperOffice Service CompactMode. This is a feature that has allowed users to access requests through a mobile device with a URL to a CompactMode version of SuperOffice Service. We will end our support effectively from SuperOffice version 11.8. From this version you will not be able to access SuperOffice Service with the CompactMode URL.

## What does this mean for you as a customer?

You can access our **SuperOffice Mobile CRM** app in our [Appstore][1]. This app allows you to access your SuperOffice Service requests in a modern native application for iOS and Android. In the app you can read, edit and create your requests on the go and get push-notifications when your requests get updated.

## Reasons for announcing End of Life are as follows

The CompactMode has been replaced by our Mobile CRM app. We would like to emphasize that the app is far richer in functionality and gives you 360-degree customer overview because of the inclusion of all standard entities in the Mobile CRM app.
