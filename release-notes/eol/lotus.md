# End of life - Lotus Notes Link

This is a formal announcement of **End of Life** for our SuperOffice Lotus Notes Link. This feature has been available for Onsite customers only. We will end our support effectively from **01.01.2024**.

## What is Lotus Notes Link?

SuperOffice Mail Link is a plug-in that links the Lotus Notes mail client with SuperOffice CRM and/or SuperOffice Service. This means that among other things, you can:

* Archive emails and attachments to SuperOffice CRM.
* Archive an email as a document or a task in SuperOffice CRM.
* Archive an email as a request in SuperOffice Service.
* Search for the sender of an email.
* Set functions for default archiving.
* Use SuperOffice templates or predefined email body templates when creating emails.
* Update the information about companies and contacts in SuperOffice CRM based on emails you receive.

## What does this mean for you as a customer?

You are recommended to switch to [SuperOffice Inbox][1]. The inbox in SuperOffice CRM is based on a separate email client, which gives you access to your email via the Internet, without requiring you to have an email program installed locally on your PC or MAC.

## Reasons for announcing End of Life

* The Lotus Notes mail client is no longer a commonly used mail client in today's market and thus rarely any of our customers are using it.

* It is based on old and outdated technology that receives very few updates from its developer.

* Security issues due to legacy libraries used in the software create a high business risk.
