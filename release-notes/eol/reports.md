# End of life - Reporter Studio and reports

This is a formal announcement of **End of Life** for our Reporter Studio and reports. You can already now leverage the new and improved solutions for customizing, analyzing, and printing your CRM data.

We will remove the **Reports** Navigator button **04.12.2024** (December). We will end our support effectively from **07.01.2025** (January).

## What is Reporter Studio and reports?

SuperOffice Reports is our legacy reporting tool, which generates statistical reports based on CRM data. Reports use predefined criteria to calculate results, and then present them in an easily formatted PDF file. Users can customize the search criteria in standard reports and in this way define their own favorite reports.

## What does this mean for you as a customer?

You have to transition to the new tools for analyzing, and printing your CRM data:

1. **Map your existing reports:** Review your saved reports, especially if they include customized criteria.

2. **Re-create your reports:** Use [selections][1] to replicate your reports by applying the same criteria. You can favorite them for easy access later by marking the star icon.

You can still [print labels directly from selections][3], or export the data to Excel and use Microsoft Word to generate custom labels.

The cross-table (d-cube) format is no longer supported in the new tools. However, you can export your data to Excel and use pivot tables for advanced analysis, or create visual insights using [dashboards][2].

### What will happen to my old reports?

Your existing archived reports remain available as PDFs in SuperOffice:

* Reports connected to companies or contacts are accessible through their respective section tabs.

* For an overview of all your old reports, we have created a selection called **Archived reports**, where you can access
all your previously generated reports.

If your reports are not linked to a company or contact, we recommend reviewing and organizing them before the Reporter tool is fully retired.

## New reporting possibilities in SuperOffice

* [Column calculations][4] (sum, average, and so on) in Selections and Find.
* Customize selection columns for printing or saving to PDF. (from version 10.3.11)
* [Print labels][3] directly from the Company or Contact section tab in Selection.
* [Print company information][5] directly from the Company card (or any other main screen in SuperOffice).

With these new ways of working with data, you will be able to:

* Adjust columns, group data, and apply calculations for more tailored overview.
* Create dynamic Dashboards: View real-time insights with drill-down capabilities, and export or print tiles as needed.
* Print or export: Customize your print overview or export your data for more detailed analysis and formatting using Excel's advanced features.

Here is how to preview and fine-tune your reports:
