# End-of-life notifications

Welcome to the end-of-life notifications section, an essential repository designed to keep you informed about the shifting landscape of our products, services, and features. End-of-life, or EOL, marks a crucial phase in the lifecycle of any technology, signaling transitions, and changes that impact your experience.

In this dedicated space, we illuminate the status of our offerings, outlining the products, services, or features approaching their end-of-life stage, those currently undergoing this transition, and the archived ones that have completed this journey. This transparency allows you to anticipate and navigate these changes with clarity and readiness.

Understanding the impact of these transitions is pivotal, and our commitment is to ensure that you have the necessary insights and resources to navigate these changes seamlessly. We invite you to explore the current notifications, anticipate the future transitions, and find support and resources to guide you through these evolving phases.

Stay informed, stay prepared, and feel empowered as we navigate these transitions together.
