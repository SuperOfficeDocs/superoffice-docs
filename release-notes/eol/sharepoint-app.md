# End of life - Microsoft 365 Document Integration (Sharepoint v1.0)

This is a formal announcement of **End of Life** for our Microsoft 365 Document Integration (Sharepoint v1.0). This feature has been available for Online customers through our AppStore only. You can already now migrate to our application [SharePoint Documents 3.0][2] - the new and improved version for handling document integration to SharePoint.

We will end our support effectively from **01.09.2024** (September). After this date you are not able to create new documents from SuperOffice until you have migrated to the new version.

## What is Microsoft 365 Document Integration (Sharepoint v1.0)?

Microsoft 365 Document Integration is an application that have provided customers with two features. First, it has enabled customers to log in with their own IDP, Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), for authentication with the user's email address. Secondly, it has offered CRM Online customers the possibility to use Microsoft 365 SharePoint for document management in SuperOffice. Users have been able to create and edit documents from any computer without a local Office package installed.

## What does this mean for you as a customer?

You have to migrate to our new features for logging in with your IDP and integrating the document storage with SharePoint.

* [Super ID][1] will let you use your own IDP for logging into SuperOffice.

* [SharePoint Documents][2] will let you store your documents in SharePoint and make you more efficient.

If you would like to migrate your documents to the new solution, we have a [guide][3] that will help you with that. We recommend that you reach out to your SuperOffice consultant to discuss how you should migrate in the best way based on your situation and configuration. If you are unsure about who to contact, you can always get in touch with our Support team through `support@superoffice.com` to get guidance and contact details to the local consultant team.

## Reasons for announcing End of Life

The Microsoft 365 Document Integration app is built on technology that is deprecated by Microsoft.

We would like to emphasize that we have created a new and better integration to SharePoint that you can migrate to, without any licence cost, and enjoy a better user-experience.

The old app also has some design aspects that aren't perfect for a lot of customers:

* In the old app, the SuperOffice Archive and the SuperOffice Template folders need to be located on the Root of the SharePoint site, and not as a sub-site or a virtual site. This means all Microsoft 365 users need minimum read-access to the Root of the SharePoint site.

* The old app requires extended access rights to run custom scripts. This is usually not according to today's best practices for IT security.
