## SuperOffice AI Lab - Easy to get started with SuperOffice Copilot

AI Lab consist of some different features and functions, the first set of features is the SuperOffice Copilot. This functionality is, for now, free of charge, so give it a try. Some of the functions are very useful in your daily work.

To get started with SuperOffice Copilot, you need to give your **consent** in **Settings and maintenance**.

Click the **Feature Labs** button in the **Licences - Status** screen and a new screen opens where you set the slider **on** for **Pilot program: AI Lab** and click **Accept** on the dialog.

You are now good to go to start using [SuperOffice AI Lab][1] with all the different magic.
