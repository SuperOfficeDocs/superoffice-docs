# Settings and maintenance 10.5.5 update

## Screen designer - Quick action buttons on Request message

To be able to create a better working space for your users, you sometimes need to fine-tune the different screens in SuperOffice. With the option to select the **quick action buttons** in the message on a request, you can fine-tune the button bar.
what you want the different users to see and not see.

In the **Screen designer**, you have the **Request** tab where you can edit the screen and select the quick action button bar. Here you can **check on** the buttons you like to **hide**.

## CRMScript - Use Class Map to add list in a script

When you are using a list component in CRMScript, it's very handy to use an **id** instead of the list name. With that option, it's possible to check on the list id to for example go to the next step in the script.
