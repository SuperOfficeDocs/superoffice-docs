# Settings and maintenance 10.5.5 update

## Screen designer - Quick action buttons on Request message

To create a better working space for your users, you may sometimes need to fine-tune the different screens in SuperOffice. By selecting the **quick action buttons** in the message on a request, you can customise the button bar to control what different users should see or not see.

In the **Screen designer**, under the **Request** tab, you can edit the screen and select the Quick action button bar. Here, you can **check on** the buttons you want to **hide**.

## CRMScript - Use Class Map to add list in a script

In CRMScript you can use **Map key-value pairs** to define list items to simplify the logic when checking selected values:

* The **key** (ID) is returned when an item is selected
* The **value** (display text) is shown to the user in the dialog

Read more about [Class Map][1] in Docs.

## CRMScript - Text field area with multiple lines

When creating a dialog in CRMScript, you often need to include a **text area** that supports multiple lines. Using the ".addTextArea" option, you can achieve this quite easily.
