# Settings and maintenance 10.5.2 update

## <a id="split-request"></a>CRMScript - Trigger to split request

When you **split a request**, you might wish to add an internal comment on **both tickets** with information about Source/new request. This is to make it easy for users to find the information from the different requests. All you have to do is to set up a CRMScript using the trigger for **Split Request** to create this internal comment.

## <a id="close-request"></a>CRMScript - Close Request tab

For instance, consider those **spam** emails you wish to get rid of with **one** single click from the **Task** button. With **CRMScript**, you can create an automated workflow that will do a lot of stuff behind the scene, where one of the events is to **close the Request tab**.
