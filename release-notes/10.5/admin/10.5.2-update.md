# Settings and maintenance 10.5.2 update

## CRMScript - Trigger to Split Request

When you split a request you might for example wish to add an internal comment on both of the tickets with information about Source/new request. This is to make it easy for users to find the information from the different requests. All you have to do is to set up a CRMScript using the trigger for Split Request to create this internal comment.

## CRMScript - Close request tab

For instance, consider those spam e-mails you wish to get rid of with a single click from the Task button. With **CRMScript** you can create an automated workflow, that will do a lot of stuff "behind" the scene, where one of the events are to **close the request tab**.
