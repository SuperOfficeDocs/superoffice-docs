# Core CRM 10.5.2 update

## Diary - The context menu on Follow-up includes Create new based on this

In your daily work with activities and follow-ups, I'm sure you have thought about how can I quickly create a new follow-up with almost the same content as an existing follow-up.

When the context menu (right-click on a follow-up) contains just what you are after, this will help you to quickly create a new follow-up based on an existing one. Go to your **Diary**, locate the follow-up you want to **duplicate**, right-click it and select **Create new based on this**.

Voila, you got your self a **new follow-up** with same information and all you need to do is to select the correct date and maybe change the time.
