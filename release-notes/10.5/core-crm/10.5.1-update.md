## Top bar - New-button

The New button has two different options, one New to create new context based content and one arrow or drop down to select between all content types.

Ex. 1: If your current view are Company, clicking the New button will create a new company.

Ex. 2: If your current view are Diary, clicking the New button will create a new follow-up.

## Top bar - Freetext search

The **freetext search** field are placed in the middle of the top bar, making it more accessible for you when searching through all content types for something.

## Top bar - In-app Resource centre button

The floating In-app Resource centre button has moved into the top bar, instead of floating in the bottom right corner. You have access to all help content in one corner and it makes it easier for you to seek help in your daily work.

## Dashboard tiles and edit

With the **Edit** button directly beside the Task button, you click one time and can start edit, add or delete dashboard tiles and save it just as easily.

## Diary - Move of Todo list and View tab with different previews

### Diary - Move of Todo list

In Diary you have two options on how to view your to-do's for Activities and Sales:

* To-do list in the top section with the Diary tabs.
* To-do list in the section tabs in the bottom.

It's pretty easy to drag and drop uncompleted follow-ups from your to-do list and into the sidepanel month, week or day view.

![Diary - To-do lists -screenshot][img9]

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer the To-do lists in the section tab in the bottom, you have to change the **Preference for Diary** - Display activities lists below diary = **Yes**. *By default this is set to No.*

![Preferences for Diary - Yes on Display activities lists below diary -screenshot][img14]

### Diary - View tab with different previews

As for the **View** tab, where you can see the calendar of more than one associates, you can choose two different previews where you swop between time grid view and timeline view:

* **Vertical/time grid view**: See your team‚Äôs calendars organised in columns for a clear overview of each day.
* **Horizontal/timeline view**: Plan across multiple days with a scrollable timeline.

## Side panel favourites

You probably have a couple of side panels you like to use, depending on the different main cards you are on. With the option to **set side panels to favourite**, you can so easily swop between the different side panels, no matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM.

Just mark the side panel with a **star** ‚≠ê and you can just click the favourite in the side panel header.

## SuperOffice Copilot - Text fields with AI options

When you write a text in like a follow up (or any other place where you have ), you sometimes want to make the text better and with more "oomph", it would have been so nice to just click a button and get that help.

With the **AI help** in the formatting footer, you do have that option ‚ú®! You can create text, fix spelling, translate, use formal style, use casual style, lengthen text or summarise text.
