# Core CRM 10.5.5 update

## Diary – create all-day events more easily

You can now click **anywhere** in your diary to create a new follow-up. This small change makes it faster and easier to update your diary with relevant information—whether it is a timed meeting or a note for the day.

If you click in the **All day** row at the top of the Day or Week tab, the Follow-up dialog opens with the **All day** option selected and **Show as** set to **Free**. These preset values save you time when creating follow-ups that span the **entire day** and act more like notes or reminders, such as "working from home," where you are still available and do not need to block your calendar.

> [!NOTE]
> The **All day** row only appears once you have at least one all day follow-up. If you do not see it, create a follow-up manually and select **All day** and **Show as: Free** to enable the row in your view.
