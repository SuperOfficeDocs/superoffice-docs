# Core CRM 10.5.5 update

## Diary - Create all day follow-up from the All day event section

All day events shows up in your **Diary** view in it's **own row** at the top. An all day event are normally a follow-up that goes over the **whole day** and are more like a note for the whole day. For example you might want to add an all day follow-up when you are working at home and not in the office, and since you are available you do not want to block the whole day.

All you need is to click the **All day area**, to create a new all day follow-up with all the settings **automatically** added.
