# Core CRM 10.5.5 update

## Diary - Create new follow-up from anywhere in your diary

Clicking anywhere in your diary gives you the option to create a new follow-up. This functionality provides a quick and convenient way to update your diary with new information.

An all day event is typically a follow-up that spans the **entire day** and serves more as a note than a scheduled appointment. For example, you might want to add an all day follow-up when you're working from home and not in the office - since you're still available, you may not want to block out the whole day. To display the all day follow-up at the top of your **Day** and **Week** view, make sure **All day** is selected and **Show as** is set to **Free**.

This also means that if you click in the **All day** row, the all day settings are applied **automatically**. If you click in the time area instead, the follow-up will be created with the standard time-based settings.

## Diary - Create all day follow-up from the All day section

All day events appear in your **Diary** view in their **own row** at the top. An all day event is usually a follow-up that spans the **whole day** and serves more like a note for the day. For example, you might want to add an all day follow-up when you're working from home and not in the office, and since you're available, you don’t want to block out the entire day.

If you don't already have the All day row in your Day or Week screen, you need to create a follow-up where the fields **All day** are selected and **Show as** is set to **Free**.

Once that is visible, you can with a single click in the **All day** area, create a new all day follow-up with all the necessary settings added **automatically**.
