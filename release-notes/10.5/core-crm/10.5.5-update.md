# Core CRM 10.5.5 update

## Diary - Create all day follow-up from the All day section

All day events appear in your **Diary** view in their **own row** at the top. An all day event is usually a follow-up that spans the **whole day** and serves more like a note for the day. For example, you might want to add an all day follow-up when you're working from home and not in the office, and since you're available, you don’t want to block out the entire day.

If you don't already have the All day row in your Day, Week or View screen, you need to create a follow-up where the fields **All day** are selected and **Show as** is set to **Free**.

Once that is visible, you can with a single click in the **All day** area, create a new all day follow-up with all the necessary settings added **automatically**.
