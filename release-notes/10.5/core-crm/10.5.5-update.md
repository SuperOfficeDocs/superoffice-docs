# Core CRM 10.5.5 update

## Diary - Create all day follow-up from the All day section

All day events appear in your **Diary** view in their **own row** at the top. An all day event is usually a follow-up that spans the **whole day** and acts more like a note for the day. For example, you might want to add an all day follow-up when you're working from home and not in the office, and since you're available, you don’t want to block out the entire day.

With a single click in the **All day** area, you can create a new all day follow-up with all the needed settings added **automatically**.
