# Core CRM 10.5.3 update

## Dashboard - Export to Excel from tile drill down

Dashboards and tiles provide a clear overview of your data, making it easier to analyze trends.

To explore specific insights, you can drill down into a tile. With the **Export** option, you can now extract this drilled-down data into **Excel**, allowing for deeper analysis and enhanced reporting.
