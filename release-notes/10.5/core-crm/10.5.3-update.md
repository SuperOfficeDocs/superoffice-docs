# Core CRM 10.5.3 update

## Dashboard - Export to Excel from tile drill down

Creating and using dashboards and tiles helps you gain a clear overview of your data, which can be difficult to achieve through a selection.

To explore specific aspects of your analytics, you can drill down into particular areas of a tile. The **Export** option allows you to extract this drilled-down data into Excel, enabling further analysis and providing **deeper insights**.
