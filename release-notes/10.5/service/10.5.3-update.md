# Service 10.5.3 update

## Requests – Preference for expanded messages

A new preference lets you control how many messages are expanded by default when viewing a request.

In **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Request**, use the *No. of expanded messages* setting to define how many messages are visible without needing to expand them manually. Adjusting this setting can also improve load times for requests with many messages.

## Requests - Quickly add a request from the section tab

The **Add** button in the **Requests** section tab provides a fast way to log customer issues.

When viewing a contact, click **Add** to [create a new request][1]. The request is automatically linked to the customer, ensuring all relevant details are captured efficiently.
