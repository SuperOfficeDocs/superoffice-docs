# Service 10.5.3 update

## Requests - Add button from the footer of requests section tabs

In SuperOffice CRM, you’ll often find an **Add** button in the footer of section tabs, providing a quick and convenient way to create new content linked to the current item.

When speaking with a customer, you may come across issues they are experiencing and need to log a request **linked to that customer**. By navigating to the Requests section tab on the contact, you can simply click **Add** to quickly **create a new request**, capturing details of the issue efficiently, and it's automatically **linked to the contact** you're looking at.
