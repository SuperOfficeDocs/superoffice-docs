# Service 10.5.5 update

## Request lists - Read column with visualisation

Working with request lists in SuperOffice often involves scanning for statuses and new details.

The **Read** column shows an **icon** and different **colours** to help you quickly identify unread, read, and updated requests at a glance. This makes it easier to scan the request lists and respond to the requests that need your attention.
