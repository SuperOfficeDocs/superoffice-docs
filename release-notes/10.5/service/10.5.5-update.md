# Service 10.5.5 update

## Request lists - Read column with visualisation

Working with request lists in SuperOffice demands a lot of scanning of statuses and new details.

The **Read** column shows an **icon** and different **colours** to identify easily unread, read, and updated requests at a glance. This will help you to scan the request lists to quickly find and answer those requests that needs your attention.
