# Service 10.5.5 update

## Request lists - Visual indicator in the Read column

When working with request lists in SuperOffice, it is important to quickly identify new or updated items.

The **Read** column now includes an icon and colour coding to help you distinguish between unread, read, and updated requests at a glance. This visual aid makes it easier to scan the list and prioritise which requests require attention.
