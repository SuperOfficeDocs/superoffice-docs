# Service 10.5.5 update

## Request lists - Read column with visualisation

Working with request lists in SuperOffice demands a lot of scanning of statuses and new details.

When the **Read** column shows both an **icon** and different **colours** to **visualise** the read status of the request, this helps you scan more easy in the request lists. And this will help you to quickly find and answer those requests that needs attention.
