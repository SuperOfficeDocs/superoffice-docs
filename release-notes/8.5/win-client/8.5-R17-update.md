# Windows client 8.5 R17 update

A lot of house cleaning has been done on the Windows client since the last release 8.5 R16, and a technical backlog for stuff under the hood. Most of these fixes are not visible, but it is some visual changes for the better.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the features below, you can find a [detailed list of fixed bugs at the end of this PDF][1].

## Appointment – Configure the Participant section of Description tab

When you add a participant to an appointment, you get a splitter between the **Description** field and the **Participant** list. You also have the possibility to configure the columns on the participant column.

To add new and delete participants, open the **Participants** tab.

## Appointment – Shows linked project guide

When working in your **Diary**, you sometimes come across appointments that are linked to either a project guide or sale guide.

The new field **Project guide** or **Sale guide** tells you it is linked and opens a preview.

And when you set the appointment to completed, the **Next** dialog (create new appointment or move to new status/stage) that often opens does not come as a surprise.

## Preview of Appointment shows the Next milestone date with link

The preview in **Side panel/Mini panel** is very useful to give more details to an archive or the Diary when selecting different entities to show.

On the **Appointment** preview you can configure to show the **Next milestone** field. Very useful when the appointment is linked to a project guide. You know when the next milestone is and you can click the link to open the next milestone appointment.

## Guide for Sales and Project and preview on side panel show your own time zone

When a customer uses time zone and has several locations over the world, it's crucial to see the actual time zone on the different appointments throughout.

The time zone field shows in the **Project guide** and **Sale guide**.

You can also configure the **Preview** and **Appointment** mini panels to show the **Time zone** field.

## Configure the Activities archive to show time zone as a column

When customers use time zone active, it's neat to show the information whenever you need it.

Configure your activities archive to show time zone, and you get a good overview to where and when the meeting is taking place.

## Preferences dialog – with Apply now button

When you are have changed the preferences, want to save the changes, but there are a few more preferences you want to check out, it's nice to have an **Apply now** button do just that. Clicking the **Apply now** button enables you to save the changes without closing the **Preference** dialog.

## Add to… dialog – A find button when adding members to Project and Sale

In all contact archives you have a possibility to use the context menu (right click) to select **Add to sale**, **Add to project**, and **Add to selection**.

![Add to… dialog -screenshot][img9]

To find the exact sale, project, or selection you want to add the members to, click the **Find** button in the archive in the right section of the dialog.
