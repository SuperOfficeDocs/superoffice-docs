# Windows client 8.5 R16 update

## Navigator – collapse navigator to only show buttons

Often you want more space for the archives and the main cards.

By clicking on the collapse of the navigator text, you just see the buttons of the different main panels.

The same functionality hides behind the menu, so you still have access to the history, fast search, and selector.

## Mini panel vs. side panel – show mini panel on the whole right section

On the top right side, you have a button that switches the layout of the mini card.

You can choose to see the mini card that gives the same height as the main card. This view is very nice to use when the selected mini panel does not need that much height, or that you need more room for the archives underneath.

Or you can choose to see the side card, that takes the whole height. This is very useful when you want to use the full height for the selected side panel, for example, a list of sales, selection, or project members.

## Mini panel – collapse mini panel to show archives in full screen

With the option to fully hide the mini card or side card, you have the full width for both the main card and archives underneath.

That is very neat when you need more columns in the archives or have text that acquires more space. The option is yours!

## Customize archives – multiple configurations on archive

For all archives, you have the option to have multiple configurations for columns, sort order, and filters.

To create a new configuration:

1. Click the **New** button.

2. In the dialog, select the type you want:

    * All companies (selected main entity), or
    * Current company: xx (main entity). The configuration will only show when on this specific company/entity.

3. In the Customize archive dialog, select the wanted columns on this view and the sort order.

You can have several configurations, and you can also create new and delete existing in the dialog. This is implemented on all archives in the Windows client.

The selected filters (Filter, Filters, and Entities) will also be set for the new configuration, so remember to select the correct filters before you create a new configuration.

## Appointment – location clickable to open app

A meeting can have an URL to a video meeting in the **Location** field on the appointment.

Then it’s very nice to just click the link in the **Preview** panel and open the correct app to have your video meeting.

The **Location** field is clickable both in the **Appointment** dialog and the preview in the Mini card. Easy and quick!

## Appointment – create new based on existing

Sometimes it would be great to use an existing appointment as a template for a new appointment.

You want the same participants, the same time (not the date), and the same text and other information. Not the same as repeating, but almost.

By selecting one, some, or all participants and right-click, you get 2 options:

* Create new appointment with selected participants
* Create new appointment with all participants

When selecting this option, a new appointment dialog is opened, today's date is selected, but you can of course change whatever field you like.

There are some fields not copied, that is due to the complex setup of the fields. This is fields like: Links and the Recurring/Repeat settings are not copied.

## Appointment – participants archive with configurable columns

The Participants archive on the appointment dialog is a NetServer based archive. You can configure the archive to show whatever columns you like.

## Mini card Appointment – configurable fields

In the Mini cards, you can configure the fields to show exactly what is best for you. This goes for all the different mini panels.

On the Participant section on the Appointment view, you have more options when you right-click on the participants.

## Activities – archive filters with buttons

When your archive is a bit narrow, it is difficult to show all entities and check-boxes in the archive footer.

![Windows -screenshot][img15]

![Windows -screenshot][img18] ![Windows -screenshot][img19]

There are 2 settings to show the different entities. **Use list box for entities**:

* OFF – Buttons
* ON – Grouped checkboxes

On some archives, it’s pretty crowded on the footer, so it’s good to make the check box section a little smaller.
