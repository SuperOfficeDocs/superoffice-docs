## Mini card – Preview documents and activities in the mini panel

Finding the information, you need quickly can be hard if your Sales or Project guide is full of appointments, meetings and documents.

To make it easier and to save you time when searching for a particular document, you can preview the content of all your documents and activities inside the mini panel.

This way you don’t have to open all documents or activities to see the content. Instead, you can check the mini panel while skipping and scanning through the information you’ve saved on them.

Save time by scanning information on documents and activities in the mini panel.
