# What’s new in SuperOffice 8.5

## Summary of highlights

SuperOffice 8.5 – is the last version of the SuperOffice CRM platform where the Windows client is supported.

Tags is a new main feature and is a powerful tool to search and group requests in SuperOffice Service.

You can set up tags in your system and tag any ticket with as many tags as you want. You are no longer limited to the standard categories. Using tags will simplify the way you save your requests and optimize your searching, listing, and filtering capabilities.

For a more efficient tag system, and to avoid duplicate tags for the same request, the ability to add or delete tags will be a functional right set by the administrator.

The SuperOffice Service Customer Centre has also given been a major update with both a modernized out-of-the-box look and feel and more importantly the ability to adjust the style to fit a company’s own corporate identity without the knowledge of HTML coding.

One of the major new features released in SuperOffice 8.5 has been the ability to send and receive appointment invitations from people outside your organization, i.e. those not using your SuperOffice Diary. The set of features associated with this makes managing your diary a whole lot easier and a lot more efficient than before.

Several of the main screens in Pocket CRM has been redesigned to offer an easier way to take action, whether that is to call, send a text, an e-mail, update a sale or make an appointment. The information presented has also been made more flexible with options for choosing what works for an individual user.
