# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R03 update

## Auto-save the information you’ve added on a request

Whenever you’re working on a request and another request comes in that has more priority, you’ll have to leave the request you are working on to solve the request that just came in.

SuperOffice will **automatically save the information** you’ve already added so you can continue where you left it when you come back to the request.

Because auto-save is saving the text in the local Storage of your browser, it will even survive a browser crash, reboot, log-out, and log-in.

It will however not transfer from one computer to another. You cannot start replying to a request at work, and then continue the reply at home. It will not be shared between two different browsers. Nor will you be able to leave work on Friday and return on Monday and expect it to be there.

The auto-save feature is out of the box ON when you use the View request (including quick reply) and Edit request (including Reply/Reply all) screens.

For custom screens, there is a new checkbox when you edit a screen where you can enable auto-save.

The auto-save continuously stores the data you input until you click on OK to send or Cancel.

Auto-save will save you time and allow you to work more efficiently when moving between screens.

## CRM Script triggers: Before and After "Quote line saved"

A CRM script helps you automate tasks or modify the behavior of SuperOffice.

Triggers are scripts that are executed for specific events in the system, such as when a new sale is created, or a request gets closed.

Triggers can react silently to what happens or block the operation and show an explanation back to the user.

It is now possible to create scripts that are executed whenever a quote line is saved.

This allows you to create your own custom rules for this process. For instance, a script can prevent users from offering discounts to non-VIP customers. Or send an email to the sales manager if the quote exceeds a specified amount.

## Personal preferences for requests and notifications available in SuperOffice CRM

In SuperOffice Service you get notified about a new request, a new message, or the fact that a request was escalated to you via:

* a popup,
* an email and,
* SMS.

You can manage your personal preferences for these notifications and your request settings in the Preferences menu in the Personal menu. You’ll find the Personal menu in SuperOffice CRM.

Here you select whether you want to receive a popup, email, or SMS by choosing **Yes** or **No** for each possible scenario.

When you’ve updated your preferences, you click **Save** to register your changes.
