In the Knowledge Base, you can create your reply template in different languages by using the feature New language body.

In the Reply template properties, you can add the content of your template in plain text or as HTML text.

To use the reply template:

1. Open a request and click **Reply**.
2. Click where it says **Insert** and find the reply template you want to use in the folder structure.
3. Select the template in the language your customer needs and press **Send**.

## Use # to search for requests with the same tags

When you want to find all requests that have the same tag(s), you can use Quick search.

You can select the tag you were looking for to get a list of all the requests that have been marked with the same tag(s).

Add multiple tags to narrow down your search even more.
