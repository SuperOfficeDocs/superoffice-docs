# Service 8.5 R01 update

## Tag your requests

You can use tags to search for and group requests based on the criteria they have in common.

The advantage of using tags is that you can search for requests using multiple tags. Where a single request can only have one category.

Your SuperOffice Administrator can assign you the functionality to create new tags.

You can search for tags by typing the name in the tag field. SuperOffice will show you a list of tags that match your description.
