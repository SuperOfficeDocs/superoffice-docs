## Chat â€“ Widget can open in new window

Due to a change in privacy on websites, most websites do not allow 3rd party cookies, so the user cannot be tracked.

But for chat, we do need to track you to keep the conversation going.

So, before we get a standard behavior, we have introduced when the chat widget is placed on an external website, will open in a new window.

With that option, the chat can keep going with a tracking of the session, and the person can finish the chat without interruptions.
