# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R07 update

## Configure your columns by grouping your requests based on tags

When you've made a selection in Service you can group the requests in your list by the different columns that are available to you.

By grouping your requests based on the **tags** used, you can easily see how many requests of each type of tag are present in your selection.

You can discover new trends of tags that have decreased or increased over time.

We have also improved the pie charts you can make from your selection. This will give you a visible representation of the different tags in your selection.
