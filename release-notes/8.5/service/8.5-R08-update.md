SuperOffice will check and validate this email addresses to make sure itâ€™s an existing domain name. If the person uses an email address with an invalid domain name, an error message will pop up, explaining their email address is not valid.

This way, only people using valid email addresses will be able to contact you through chat and web forms.

It will improve the quality of the customer data you save in SuperOffice CRM.
