# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R11 update

## Standard reports to monitor Chat conversations

SuperOffice Service now contains 5 **standard reports for Chats.**

![Service -screenshot][img1]

You’ll be able to monitor incoming chats and the workload of your support team per hour of the day and for different days of the week.

With these reports you can, for example, see when your team receives the highest number of chats during a day. Or how long people have to wait on average before they receive help.

You'll get an insight into the volume of the chats your company receives for each chat widget that you use on your websites.
