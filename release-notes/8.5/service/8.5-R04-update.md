## Configure your request settings from the SuperOffice CRM Settings and maintenance

As a CRM administrator, you are now able to customize your Service solution from inside the SuperOffice CRM administrator client.

You’ll find that 3 new icons have been added:

* Requests
* Customer center
* System design

You can use these features to change and configure your Service solution.

These extra icons are only visible for those companies who have the Service user plans as part of their licenses.

In addition, to see and customize Service via the System design set of features, your company needs to have activated the subscription for Expander Services.

These features are currently only available for SuperOffice CRM Online users.

## Add extra-fields to columns and search criteria

In SuperOffice Standard CRM you can now make selections and search for companies or contacts using fields you’ve added in SuperOffice Service.

Let’s say you have created an extra field inside Service for the different types of customer service levels. For example, you have an extra field that’s called "service level" and for example have added values such as "Platinum", "Gold", "Silver", and "Bronze" as the different levels.

You are now able to not only find the companies with any of these values inside Service, but you are also able to search and create a selection of contacts and companies based on these fields from within the SuperOffice Standard interface. For example, a selection of all companies with a platinum service level, and so on.

You need to have Service or Complete user plan to access Service and have an active subscription for Expander Services to add extra-fields. You can add extra fields in the System menu. Go to System design and choose Tables. Here you can add extra fields.

Once you’ve added your field, these fields will automatically be available when you use the Find feature, selections and when you configure your columns on the Company or Contact card for example.

With this latest change, it is possible to access and use information saved in your Service solution from inside the Standard CRM solution.

These features are currently only available for SuperOffice CRM Online users.
