# Service 8.5 R05 update

## Select extra table relations fields to be visible as columns and search criteria

Extra-fields linked to the company, contact, and request fields inside SuperOffice Service are available in Find, selection, and as columns inside the CRM client.

As extra tables in Service may be configured to consist of more than one level this capability has been expanded.

It is now possible to select if any additional levels also should be made displayed as fields in Find, selection, and columns inside the CRM client.

This is particularly relevant when the extra tables in Service relate to each other.

For example, say extra fields have been created for with a structure for "Lease agreements" and "Building" where a Company has "Lease agreement" for a particular "Building".

With the added level, it is possible to find the relevant connection between the Company, Building, and Lease agreement to view or act upon this information in many different contexts.

## Configure the Customer Centre via a new configuration tab in Settings and Maintenance

The **Customer Center** is a standalone portal that can be integrated into any existing website and is a component available for all who have access to the Service feature set.

Through the Customer Center a company’s end-customers can log in, view their request history, ask questions and search in the knowledge database 24/7.

To provide the best customer experience, the look and feel of this self-service portal should be similar to that of a company’s corporate branding. It reassures a customer that they are in the right place.

Historically even simple changes to Customer Center required knowledge about how files used by the Customer Center are structured as well as web design coding. This made it overly complex to change.

The new Customer Center configuration feature set instead allows an admin user, without any prior knowledge about web design coding, to quickly and easily change certain pre-defined configurable elements.

Options include adding forms and chat to a Customer Centre.

Introducing this feature does not limit customers with already customized designs or with more advanced needs, but rather is a building block using more up-to-date design as a baseline.

This new feature is available for customers using the SuperOffice Service or the Complete user plan and version 8.5 R05 or newer.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available out-of-box for all new customers and the configuration is populated with default values.

Existing customers with customized pages will not have their pages replaced. They have to manually convert to use the new configuration options for their Customer Centre pages.

## Chat used inside the Customer Centre will have automated authentication

**Chat** can be used in combination with the Customer Centre whereby users of a Customer Centre can reach out via chat.

If a user who has logged in to a Customer Centre initiates a chat via the Customer Centre, they will in addition be automatically authenticated.

This means that the user does not have to give their contact details for a responding chat agent to know who they are, find their past history, or log the chat conversation under the right contact card.

This makes it even more convenient for users of a Customer Centre to use chat, and easier for agents to respond in the best possible way.
