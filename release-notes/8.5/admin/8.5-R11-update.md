# Settings and maintenance 8.5 R11 update

## Email invitation preferences

There are new **Preference** settings available in respect to email invitations.

![Admin -screenshot][img1]

You can **manage incoming invitations** in Settings and maintenance, under the tab **Preferences** where you can select **Email** to define how you want to manage incoming invitations.

![Admin -screenshot][img2]

Four options are available:

* Enable all
* Disable creation of tentative appointments for invitations
* Disable creation, updates, and replies to invitations
* Disable all

You can set up how incoming invitations should be managed for the entire system, a group, or specific users.

In **Preferences** you’ll also find the option to use **iCalender attachments** in your emails. By default, the value for this feature is *Yes*.

In the **Global preferences** tab, you’ll also find email settings where you can set whether you want the **diary synchronization** should be *on* or *off*.

By default the diary synchronizer is turned on and has the value: *Yes*.

When this feature is *active*, the reply buttons on the email will be disabled and SuperOffice will not create tentative appointments in a users’ diary.

When the features are *inactive*, the reply buttons will be available and you’re able to see tentative appointments in your diary.

In the **Personal settings** you can manage your personal preferences. The Default value is where you choose which **activity type** you wish to use when you receive an incoming email invitation.

## Email templates

You are now able to create **email templates** in a similar way to other document templates.

Email templates are created in the **Settings and maintenance** view of SuperOffice CRM. Under **Lists,** you’ll find all the email templates currently saved and you can add new ones.

When you create a new email template, you can create a normal template or you can choose to create a new quote, order confirmation, or privacy confirmation.

You may add a new email template by creating a new one from scratch, by uploading a template, or by copying an existing one.

Email templates available for a user inside SuperOffice CRM will also be available as options directly from within their SuperOffice inbox or in Outlook via the Mail Link.

In the **SuperOffice inbox** click on the arrow by the **New** button to open the dropdown list of email templates available to you.

Inside Outlook, a new button will appear named “SuperOffice Message” that directly accesses and opens templates as a new mail. See below for more details.

## Monitor your metered services

Metered services are services you pay for once you exceed a certain number of:

* Storage space used
* Emails sent via Mailings
* Customer Center logins reached
* Chat sessions started
* Form submissions submitted

The threshold depends on the number of users. The more users you have, the higher the threshold will be.

To make sure **you can monitor your usage levels** of these services, there is a dashboard to the Licenses module added in Settings and maintenance. You can open and monitor the dashboard by clicking the **Metered services** button.

Administrators can follow exactly how much of each service has been used per month.

Whenever your company exceeds the threshold, **you’ll automatically be invoiced** for these services on your next monthly invoice.

## Save users on a different company card

Sometimes you want to change the company a user is registered on. For example, when a colleague moves from one office to another, or when they start working for the same company in a different country.

You can administrate your users in the Settings and maintenance module.

To change the company a user is registered to you open the **Users module** and go to the tab **Associates**. When you’ve selected the user, you want to move to another company, you can click on the company name underneath the user’s name and email address on the right-hand side.

On the **Move user** dialog, you can save the selected user on another company.
