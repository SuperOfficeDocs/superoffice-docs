# Settings and maintenance 8.5 R02 update

## Web Tools – Preference to control the appearance of Web tools install

If SuperOffice Web Tools is not installed or when there is a new version available, the installation will be offered through a splash screen.

Sometimes administrators want to control who gets to see the **WebTools** wizard. This is possible via new preferences in Settings and maintenance where the default settings can be specified to only be specific user/s.

This is particularly helpful when a company uses desktop virtualization and how to roll out new versions of anything software is centrally managed.
