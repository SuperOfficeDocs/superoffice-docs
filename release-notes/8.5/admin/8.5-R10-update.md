## More efficient user management

The management of users has been improved to make it easier to administrate users in general and when handling large numbers of users in particular.

First, the **User admin** screen is split into two parts with a vertical resizable split. The vertical split is to give you the possibility to exploit the entire space for working with a long list of users.

The User ID and authentication fields are found in the Details tab where you can also set **User plan**, **Role** and what **Primary groups** and the **Service categories** and **Service categories from user groups** this person should have access to.

The setting to allow a user the ability to set archive items as confidential is now available under the Licenses tab.

It is possible to **search** for users based on a user’s name, role, primary group, and more.

In addition, you can enable **grouping and filters**. This way it’s a lot easier to find groups of users to manage their details.
