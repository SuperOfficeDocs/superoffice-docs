## Move a user from one owner card to another

Sometimes in a larger organization, it is relevant to move a user from one owner card to another. For example, if an existing employee of one subsidiary begins working for another subsidiary.

In this version, this no longer creates friction in the usersâ€™ diaries or archive histories, as it is possible to move the user from one owner card to another.

By clicking on the **Task** menu in the **User administration** screen, a new dialog box appears giving you the option to move a user.

Options for existing activity history include:

* To leave all activities registered on the old owner company card
* Move all to the new owner card
* Move all activities starting from a specific date

Whichever option works in a given situation, the user can continue working in SuperOffice under the new owner card without any hassle.
