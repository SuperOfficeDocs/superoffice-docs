## Prevent import of contacts not registered in your SuperOffice

When you’re creating a new mailing, you can add your recipients in step 4 of the mailing wizard.

Normally you add recipients by choosing a single contact, a selection, or a project you’ve created in SuperOffice CRM.

Yet, sometimes it’s easier to use a selection or list you’ve created in a different solution, like your ERP solution for example.

Especially when it’s hard to re-create this list in SuperOffice it’s pretty useful that you can import this contact list using a comma-separated file (txt, CSV, or similar).

Make sure the contacts you want to import are registered in SuperOffice. Because contacts who are not registered in SuperOffice will be skipped, which means they won’t be included in your recipients list.

After all, you can’t follow up on a contact who isn’t registered in SuperOffice CRM or add them to a project, selection, or a future mailing.

By only using registered contacts in your mailing, you’ll prevent bounces and improve your mailing results.
