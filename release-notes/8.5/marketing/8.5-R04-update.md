To avoid spam that sabotages your data collection, there are mechanisms that protect your website and the web forms you use from automated bots. One commonly used mechanism is **reCAPTCHA**, a free service that protects your website from spam and abuse.

The reCAPTCHA **Iâ€™m not a robot** checkbox will ensure that only real users will be able to leave their information on the web forms you use.
