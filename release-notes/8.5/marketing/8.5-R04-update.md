# Marketing 8.5 R04 update

## Use Google reCAPTCHA for web forms

To avoid spam that sabotages your data collection, there are mechanisms that protect your website and the web forms you use from automated bots. One commonly used mechanism is **reCAPTCHA**, a free service that protects your website from spam and abuse.

The reCAPTCHA **I'm not a robot** checkbox will ensure that only real users will be able to leave their information on the web forms you use.

> [!NOTE]
> These features are currently only available for SuperOffice CRM Online users.
