You can browse all templates or search by keywords such as theme and colors.

You can open the form template you like by clicking on it. If you want to use it immediately, simply click on Use this template. This will open the form edit view where you may finalize the form for use. Or you can click on Import template to use it later.

All form templates can be further edited by you to fit your own needs and profile before you publish the form where you want it to appear.
