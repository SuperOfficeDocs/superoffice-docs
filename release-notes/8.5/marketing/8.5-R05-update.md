# Marketing 8.5 R05 update

## New fields for creating a request directly via forms

New form fields are available which allows a submitted form to create a new ticket directly in SuperOffice Service. Up until now, it has been possible to ask to be **notified** via a request ticket that a form had been submitted. This for example is useful when all new form submissions are to be manually processed. The request ticket alerts to look at and then process the new form submission.

The new form fields (listed below) create a new request when the form is submitted and adds the content of the form fields directly into the request.

* request title
* request category (this will display the list of external categories
* request message

When any of these fields are added to a form, a fallback category and priority have to be defined as **Actions**. This ensures that a new request is attended to, no matter what fields have been completed by a form submitter.

Note that for a form to be used inside a Customer Centre, the form has to contain at least one of these request-specific fields. Only activated forms with these fields will appear as options under the Customer Centre configuration panel.
