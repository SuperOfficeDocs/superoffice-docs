You can easily see what type of document you are looking from the word, excel, PPT, and PDF logos.

Clicking on any document will **automatically open** the document in the preview screen, where you can see the document directly on your mobile phone.

If your mobile isn’t able to open the document, you will be given the option to select another application to open the document in.

> [!NOTE]
> Android users will only be able to preview images!

If the document is large and takes some time to download, this will be displayed whilst waiting, as will the option to cancel the download should the download take too long.

Once opened it can viewed with an option for showing the document in **full screen,** collapsing the top banner to give more screen space.

At the top of this preview screen you’ll see 3 useful buttons that allow you to share the document, email the document, and view the details of the document.

With the new document screen it’s easier to see, edit and share all the documents you’ve got save in SuperOffice CRM.
