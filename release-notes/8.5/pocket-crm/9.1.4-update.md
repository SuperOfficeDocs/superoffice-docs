First, new **action buttons** have been added at the top of the Sales card to make it easier to book your closing meetings, call a contacts, send an emails, and see your sales dashboard.

A visual presentation lets you see exactly what **Sales stage** in the sales process you are. By clicking on the current stage, you can change the status of your sales opportunity.

You also have full access to all the activities and documents connected to this sale.

And finally, a new tab for **Stakeholders** has been added to the Sales screen where you’ll see all the people involved in the sales opportunity. You can easily access their Contact card, from the sale by clicking their name.
