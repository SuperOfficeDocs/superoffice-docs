# 8.5 R17 update

## OAuth – Open Authorization for Inbox / Open Authorization for Mail boxes

Due to the announcement that **Microsoft will stop supporting Basic Authentication** against Office 365 email services by October 2020, there is implemented a new login solution for Inbox login.

To be able to log into the Inbox and set up the Service mail boxes, OAuth 2.0 is used to support IMAP and SMTP AUTH protocols in Exchange Online.
