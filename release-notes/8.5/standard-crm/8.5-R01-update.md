# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R01 update

## Inbox – New design of the "unknown person, do you want to add to SuperOffice"

When you use the integrated Inbox in SuperOffice CRM and you’ve received a new email from an unknown email address, a yellow banner will notify you that this person isn’t registered in SuperOffice yet.

When you click the yellow banner a new dialog will open. Here you can add and save the contact’s email address on a new or existing contact card.

This feature is available from your web inbox, chat, forms, and request panels.

We’ve also added the title field here, so you can add Mr. and Ms. To your contacts.
