## Appointment – Invitation fixes

For external invitations where the sender is not found, the invitation will show in the diary as a tentative booking. Only the associate will get the booking, not all participants.

## Appointment & Document – Link for Add project

You can add links for Project in both the **Appointment** and **Document** dialog. It means you can add links both from the appointment and document dialogs and from the project main card.

## Inbox – Possible to set other default folders

When you want to select other folders than the default folder for Inbox, Sent items, Drafts, and Deleted items, you can do so in the Preferences in the Settings and maintenance.

For companies that use a specific setup for the different folders, this is possible to change for all, selected groups or users.

## Inbox – Automatic refresh of the inbox folders

When you log into your Inbox, all emails are loading. When continuing to use the inbox clicking the **Refresh** button will load all new emails and are visible for the user.
