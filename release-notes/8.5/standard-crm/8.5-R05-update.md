# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R05 update

## Upgraded HTML editor to Froala 3.0

The HTML editor in Settings and Maintenance has been upgraded to include the use of **Froala 3.0**. This upgrade ensures the latest features of this editor tool are available to users of SuperOffice.

Froala is a rich-text editor feature that is used in connection with:

* creating new email templates in Settings & Maintenance
* creating new emails via the SuperOffice Inbox
* creating double opt-in, thank you, and inactive form pages
* the editor used in connection with chat
* the editor used to create new email signatures (not the email signature inside a request)

> [!NOTE]
> SuperOffice CRM uses a separate email signature than the one linked to a request and the editor of the latter does not use Froala. The reason for having 2 email signatures is because a user most often does not want to provide all their personal contact details when replying to a request ticket.

## Sign up to be a pilot customer/user from Settings and Maintenance

Users who are interested in getting early access to new features can sign up to pilot programs directly from the **Preferences** tab in SuperOffice CRM. It is also possible for a company to sign up via Preferences inside Settings & Maintenance.

The current pilot programs running at any point in time are included as options under **Functions**.

When someone opts-in to a pilot program, they will gain early access to the new feature and be able to provide feedback and comments.

More information about all currently running pilot projects is available on the [community product release page][1].
