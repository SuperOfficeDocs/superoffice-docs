# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R14 update

## Send and receive email invitations from external people

Earlier this year we introduced the functionality to send and receive email invitations from people inside your organization.

With SuperOffice 8.5 R14, you can send and receive email invitations to invite external people to meetings and to accept and decline proposed meetings from external people. This new set of features makes managing your diary easier.
