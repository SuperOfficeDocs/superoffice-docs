# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R10 update

## New field for "Main Contact" on Company card

A new field is added to the Company card called **Main contact**.

This field makes it easy to see who your main contact is when first looking at a Company card.

This field also replaces the Rank 1 contact and its role in mailings. So when you create a new or refresh an existing selection, you can select the checkbox **Include main contact** to add the main contact of each company to the selection results.

For existing company cards, the contact with Rank 1 today will automatically be displayed as the main contact.

This field also replaces the **Primary Contact** field in SuperOffice Service. If you use the Primary contact field today, the label will change but the current data for Service will remain and the name for primary contact will not be replaced with the name ranked as 1 in the standard interface.

On new companies, the first person added will automatically be set as the main contact.

If the main contact is marked as **former employee** or **deleted**, the person with the lowest rank will then automatically be set as the main contact. This way there is always a Main contact.

You can manually change the contact registered here by clicking the **Edit** button. A drop-down list with all available contacts registered on the company card will appear.
