# SuperOffice Standard CRM 8.5 R06 update

## Open old SOM emails to read their content

For many years SuperOffice CRM used SOM files to save emails. Later MSG files replaced SOM and are the standard for all mails now.

However, this change meant that it wasnâ€™t possible for customers who migrated to SuperOffice CRM Online to open old emails based on the old SOM file format.

This has been addressed so that it is possible to open and read all emails saved in your database, it is now possible again to open SOM files in SuperOffice CRM.
