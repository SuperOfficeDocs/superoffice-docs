By analyzing the performance of your web forms you can improve the fields and details on your web forms to increase the number of conversions.

## Preview email attachments from the SuperOffice inbox

When you receive an email with an attachment, it’s a huge benefit if you can see the content of the document without having to open it completely. A preview saves time and reduces the need to open Word or Adobe Reader.

In the built-in inbox, you can preview all Word, PDF, JPEG, and PNG files to see the content of the document. PowerPoint and Excel are not yet supported.

With the email attachment preview feature, you’ll have access to valuable information faster.
