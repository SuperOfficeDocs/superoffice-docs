This new set of features makes managing your diary a whole lot easier.

> [!NOTE]
> The following features only apply when you receive invitations in your inbox or create new appointments involving people not using your SuperOffice CRM diary. When you **only invite colleagues using SuperOffice CRM** to a meeting, SuperOffice will, by default, never send out an email invitation.

When you **receive a meeting invitation from an external contact** (someone outside your organization), you can accept their invitation to save the meeting details in your SuperOffice Diary. Until the moment you accept or decline the invitation, it will be saved in your diary as a **tentative** appointment.

Inside your SuperOffice inbox, you can also see a preview of your diary on the day of the appointment, so you can easily see if you are available for the meeting or not.

When you **receive an invitation from an unknown person** (somebody who isn’t registered in SuperOffice or who is registered multiple times) the meeting will **not** be visible in your diary as a tentative appointment.

You are however able to accept this invitation and save the meeting without a company and contact. In this instance, SuperOffice will save a standard text on the activity including the name of the organizer. On the appointment, SuperOffice saves the date, time, and location.

A new email invitation will show up in SuperOffice as:

* a tentative appointment in your Diary
* an email in your web inbox
* a notification in the Invitations dialog

Some **email invitations contain an attachment**. If you wish to save the attachment, it’s important to save the attachment **before** you accept the invitation. Once you’ve accepted or declined the invitation, the email will be removed from your inbox.

Sometimes **multiple internal people are invited to the same meeting by the external contact**. If one of the internal meeting participants has configured SuperOffice email by either Outlook MailLink or the web inbox, **all internal participants** will be added to the appointment in SuperOffice and the appointment will appear in all the internal participants' diary.

If the person who invites you to the meeting is unknown to SuperOffice, however, only the person who accepts the appointment will see the meeting in their diary. The other participants who use SuperOffice, will not see the appointment in their SuperOffice diary. They only see the email invitation in their inbox.

You can also **send out meeting invitations to people outside your organization**. In the appointment, on the **Participants** tab, you can see the status of the invitation:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| Blank | The contact has not replied to the invitation |
| A green check | The contact has accepted the invitation |
| A red cross | The contact has declined the invitation |
| An eye | The external contact has answered tentatively |

As soon as a participant to a meeting replies, the attendance status of that participant will change from blank to one of the other three options within the appointment.

Email invitations are supported for all platforms of SuperOffice CRM. The feature is rolled out gradually, so if you do not have access to it yet, you’ll get access to it soon.

> [!NOTE]
> There are new preference settings for email invitations available in Settings and Maintenance and options for adding email templates. See below for more details.
>
> If you are already synchronizing your Diary with the Outlook calendar using either Synchronizer for SuperOffice or Exchange Synchronizer, then this new feature will automatically be adjusted to avoid duplication. Specifically, the reply buttons in the Inbox will be disabled for incoming invitations, and tentative appointments will not be created in the Diary.
