# Settings and maintenance 10.1.6 update

## Screen designer – Configurable archives/section tabs

When you personalise the layout for the main cards and archives/tab sections it will match your organisation’s information needs.

You can **edit the layout** by adding or removing section tabs/archives on the different main cards for:
* Company,
* Contact,
* Sale and
* Project.

To **remove** standard section tab, select the tab you want to remove, go to **Task** and choose **Remove tab**. If you regret removing the tab or any changes done to the section tab, click the **Restore tabs** menu item or the **Reset to factory settings**.

To **add** a new section tabs, you add a new section tab on any main cards you like. Click the **Add** button, write the new tab **name** and add a description to it. In **Settings** you select the content you want to show in the new tab. Depending on the main card choosen, you can add a new tab with contents of:
* Document, 
* Appointment,
* Product,
* Project,
* Project member,
* Sale,
* Sale stakeholder,
* Request,
* Contact and
* Relation.

All that is left, is to decide the different **criteria** to filter the content to your specific needs. You also can set up different actions in the advanced option.

If you have user groups that do have different needs for the section tabs, you have the same option to create multiple layouts for the different user groups.

Create the **new layout**, name it, select the user group(s) in the assign to section and add a description.
