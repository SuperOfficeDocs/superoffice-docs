# Settings and maintenance 10.1.6 update

## Screen designer – Configurable archives/section tabs

This feature requires a license for [Development Tools][2]. This is an additional cost per site.

When you personalize the layout for the main cards and archives/tab sections it will match your organization's information needs.

You can **edit the layout** by adding or removing section tabs/archives on the following main cards:

* Company
* Contact
* Sale
* Project

To **remove** standard section tab, select the tab you want to remove, go to **Task** and choose **Remove tab**. If you regret removing the tab or any changes done to the section tab, click the **Restore tabs** menu item or the **Reset to factory settings**.

To **add** a new section tabs:

1. Click the **Add** button, write the new tab **name** and add a description to it.
1. In **Settings**, select the content you want to show in the new tab. Depending on the main card chosen, the options are:

    * Document
    * Appointment
    * Product
    * Project
    * Project member
    * Sale
    * Sale stakeholder
    * Request
    * Contact
    * Relation

1. All that is left, is to decide the different **criteria** to filter the content to your specific needs. You also can set up different actions in the advanced option.

Multiple layouts are supported. That means each user group can have unique section tab layouts.

Create the **new layout**, name it, select the user group(s) in the assign to section and add a description.
