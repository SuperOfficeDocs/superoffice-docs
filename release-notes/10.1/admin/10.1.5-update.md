# Settings and maintenance 10.1.5 update

## Lists – GUI Web panel with reload settings

You can add web panels on a lot of different places in SuperOffice CRM.

To avoid reload of the web panel, you check **OFF** the check box for **Always reload content on tab navigator**.

This is manly to decrease the use of bandwidth and make the feel of slower SuperOffice CRM.

If it’s important that user should have an updated webpage or the webpage needs to run a reload, then you need to set the check box to **ON**.
