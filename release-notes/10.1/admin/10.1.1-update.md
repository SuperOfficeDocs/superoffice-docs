# Settings and maintenance 10.1.1 update

## Screen designer – add Macro as a button in CRM

Some users might find it efficient to have a **Create Appointment** button on a main card. And if you want to run a specific script when you create a new appointment from the **Company** card, that is very efficient.

1. Create a new button on the **Company** card.
2. Set the button up with a CRMScript to run whatever you like.

## Options – Add customer languages from Settings and maintenance

To set up the different customer languages for your Service setup, it's easy to do so in Settings and maintenance on the **Options** overview.
