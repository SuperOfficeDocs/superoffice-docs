# SuperOffice Mobile CRM 10.2.2 update

## Notifications – Notifications for Sale Quote approval

In Mobile CRM you will now be notified if someone needs **approval** for their sale quote to be sent to customer. You can see all the important details about the sale in Mobile CRM and **Approve** or **Deny** the sale quote. The person who issued the approval will get notified immediately. This makes the quote approval flow easy and without any friction. The sale must go on.

## Search – Search for anything

The search engine for Company/Contact, Sale and Project gives you the option to search for any property within an entity, like phone number, email address, project number, and so on.

You start the search from the **Search** button on your keyboard, which is closer to your thumb.
