# What's new in SuperOffice 10.1

## Summary of highlights

[!include[ALT](../includes/v10-intro.md)]

## Breaking changes

### Onsite username/password and Windows authentication

In the previous SuperOffice versions, when you supplied credentials to the SuperOffice login dialog, NetServer tried to authenticate the user against SuperOffice database and when it failed, it tried also against AD. This system allowed for a mix of both SuperOffice logins and AD logins without any additional setup.

The possibility to have mixed logins was removed in SuperOffice **10.1.5**.
But reimplemented in version **10.1.6** (05.10.2022), due to a lot of unexpected problems.
You can [read more on the forums][1].
