# Marketing 10.1.6 update

## Mailing – Document mailing with language

When you create a Document mailing, you use the different templates in your system.

If that template is in **multiple languages**, you get an option in **step 2** to select the wanted **template language** for the mailing.

The dialog shows the drop down of all the **language** the template is stored with, just choose the wanted one, and continue to edit the document mailing.
