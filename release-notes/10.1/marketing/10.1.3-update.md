# Marketing 10.1.3 update

## Form – Set up Our contact with a default on form submissions

In forms you set up different Actions on the form submission. This are important especially when you select that the contact is added automatically.

You have the option to set different defaults on fields like:

* **Our contact**
* Category
* Business

This will give better data in SuperOffice and the customer/contact can be found easier.
