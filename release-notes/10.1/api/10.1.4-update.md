# API 10.1.4 update

## API – CRMScript

Improvements to CRMScript:

* Added two new functions to arrays and structs: `toJSONString()` and `fromJSONString()`, which will directly use a string as input or output.

* Arrays now have a `buildString()` method, which creates a delimited string of its members.

* Structs can implement a `toString()` method. This will work together with the `buildString()` function above, but will also as a bonus make variables of these types better to view in the debugger/tracer.

* Error messages for incorrect array functions are now shown at the correct source position.

* Support for `sort()` on arrays. Basic types will be sorted normally, such as Integers, strings or floats.

* Structs that implement a compare(struct s) function are used when sorting an array of that struct type.

* [Array][1]
* [Struct][2]
