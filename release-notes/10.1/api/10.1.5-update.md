# API 10.1.5 update

## API - Quote Connector for Approval/Rejection

Quote Connector API for Approval/Rejection is in there for SOAP and on-site DLLs as well as the yet-to-be-released REST connector.

WCF connector will detect missing Approve/Reject methods on remote service and ignore errors from them. WCF connector will avoid calling if methods are flagged as missing.

QuoteConnector plugins must implement new IQuoteConnector2 interface to add support for approve/reject methods.
