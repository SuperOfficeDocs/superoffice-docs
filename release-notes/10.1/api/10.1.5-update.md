# API 10.1.5 update

## API - Quote Connector for Approval/Rejection

Quote Connector API for Approval/Rejection is in there for SOAP and on-site DLLs as well as the yet-to-be-released REST connector.

WCF connector will detect missing Approve/Reject methods on remote service and ignore errors from them. WCF connector will avoid calling if methods are flagged as missing.

QuoteConnector plugins must implement new [IQuoteConnector2][3] interface to add support for approve/reject methods.
