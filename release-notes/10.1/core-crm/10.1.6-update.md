# Core CRM 10.1.6 update

## Sale - Sales targets

To manage your sales goal is easy when defining your sales targets (budget). With the **Sales Premium** license you  have acces to **Targets**.

Open the Targets dialog by clicking **Main menu** in the top bar, or the **Task** button on **Dashboards**.

Click on the button **+Add groups and users** to select wanted user group for your sales target. Here you can choose between the whole company and user groups (users in the groups will automatically be added).

When all numbers are done, you do have the option to **Export to excel** from the **Task button** in the left bottom corner.

You can now add all the target numbers for each section you have added. You do have some options to copy one line to the other or adjust from last year. Just use the **Task** button on each line to **Adjust numbers**.

You need to have the functional right **Targets administrator** for your role to add, edit and remove target types.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need **Sales Premium** license together with the **Unlimited sales targets license** to add more than one user group. If you only have Sales Premium license you are able to add one group for the target type **All sales – Amount**.
