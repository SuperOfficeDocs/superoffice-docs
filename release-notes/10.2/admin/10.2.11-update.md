# Settings and maintenance 10.2.11 update

## CRMScript tracing limits and notifications

**Max number of trace-runs and storage:** A script trace will be disabled when it has traced 100 times or the sum of saved data for that trace reaches 100MB. If you have reached the limit, manually delete some trace-runs or wait until they expire. Expired trace-runs are automatically deleted nightly. Remember to re-enable the trace to resume tracing.

The number of runs and accumulated data size are shown per trace and in the list of traces.

**Only trace when it is required:** when editing the trace, you can select to save the trace-run only when the script has an unhandled exception, or if the function 'forceSaveTrace(true)' is called within the script. The checkbox has effect only if the script trace exists and is enabled.

**Notifications:** While editing the trace, you have the option to enable notifications. This feature pairs well with the exception-only setting. Input the email address where you'd like notifications sent after saving a trace run. To avoid excessive emails, indicate the number of emails you wish to dispatch; this count will decrease with each email sent.
