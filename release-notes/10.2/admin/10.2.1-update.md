# Settings and maintenance 10.2.1 update

## Task menu list

You can set up new tasks in the different task menus around the SuperOffice modules.

Go to **Lists** > **Task menu** and select where in the module you want to add the task. The task can be a URL, a CRMScript or from the SoProtocol, and it can also be shown upon right-clicks and in Mobile CRM.
