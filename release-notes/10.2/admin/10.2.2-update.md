# Settings and maintenance 10.2.2 update

## Email domain validation

SPF - Sender Policy Framework is an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses during the delivery of the email.

With the help of a global preference **Only use approved email sending domains** and a list **Mailing domains**, you can make sure the users using mailing will select the correct domain email address.

Read more about how to use [email domains][1] in Marketing and mailing.

### Global preference

To set on the controlled mailing domains in the Global preferences, find the Marketing section and the preference **Only use approved email sending domains** and select **Yes** to enable the function.

If you choose to say **No** to this preference, you still got a warning in Marketing if the email address is not an approved domain.

### Lists - Mailing domains

You add the different mailing domains your company should use when sending out mailings to your contacts. As soon as you say yes for the global preference on approved email domains, this list will appear in the first step on Mailings. If you choose to say No for this preference, this list will not be visible or used in SuperOffice.

Find the **list** for **Mailing domains**, add the different domains you want to use in the list.
