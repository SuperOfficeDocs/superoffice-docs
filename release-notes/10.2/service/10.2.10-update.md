# Service 10.2.10 update

## Add Domain for a company

When dealing with requests from multiple customers it's handy to get new customers connected to existing companies automatically.

Adding domains to a company is a neat way of connecting the new contacts to the correct company.

To maintain the different domains, click on the **Task** button on a **company**, select **Manage domains** and add wanted domain(s) in the dialog.

The next time an unknown contact with this e-mail address domain sends a request, the contact is automatically connected to this company.

## Send SMS from a request

When dealing with customers that only use mobile phones, you can, with the correct setup and a **SMS provider**, send out requests by SMS.

Just select the correct contact with phone number and send the request.

## Change the default style for outbound e-mails on requests

Dealing with contacts and customers is an united front for a company. Being able to fine-tune the outbound e-mail sent from all the users in a company, makes it easier to have a **common appearance**.

Open the **Settings and maintenance** module, click on the **Preferences** navigator and select the **Global preferences** tab. Find the **Default style for outbound e-mails** and add wanted html code into the field.

## More compact text format area for requests

Working on smaller screens gives you naturally a smaller area to work on handling requests.

The text format options is grouped by type, and clicking on the **more**-button, you get more possibilities in formatting your text. So normally you have one line with formatting options, clicking on the more-button gives you a **second line** with even more options depending on the **group** you selected.

## Old Service client - Script trigger on outgoing e-mail

We have in our **Old Service** module multiple script triggers.

The event is named **Outbound email or SMS created**. The EventData instance will contain several input values relevant to the context.
