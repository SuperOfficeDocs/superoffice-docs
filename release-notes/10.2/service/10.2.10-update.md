# Service 10.2.10 update

## Add domain for a company

When dealing with requests from multiple customers, it's handy to connect a new customer to an existing company automatically. Adding domains to a company is a neat way of connecting the new contacts to the correct company.

To maintain the different domains:

1. Go to a company.
1. Click the **Task** button and select **Manage domains**.
1. Enter a valid email domain and click **Add**. Repeat for additional domains.
1. Click **Save** when you are done.

The next time an unknown contact with this email address domain sends a request, they are automatically connected to this company.

## Send SMS from a request

When dealing with customers that use only mobile phones, you can, with the correct setup and an **SMS provider**, send out requests by SMS.

Just select the correct contact with phone number and send the request.

## Change the default style for outbound emails on requests

Dealing with contacts and customers is an united front for a company. Being able to fine-tune the emails sent by all users in a company, makes it easier to have a **common appearance**.

1. Go to Settings and maintenance and select **Preferences** in the navigator.
1. Select the **Global preferences** tab.
1. In the **Default style for outbound e-mails** field, enter HTML code. For example:

    ```html
    <p style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif; color: grey; font-size:10pt;"></p>
    ```

1. Click **Save**.

## Compact text format area for requests

Space is limited when handling requests on smaller screens. The compacted text formatting bar lets you view more of the message content.

By default, you have one row of options. Click the **More** button to show additional options. Text formatting options are grouped by type.
