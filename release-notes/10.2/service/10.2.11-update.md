# Service 10.2.11 update

## Preview with quick edit

When reviewing a list of requests, you may notice the need to make minor adjustments to a request. In the preview of the request, you can use the drop-down lists to efficiently change the status, owner, and category.

## Rearrange Request section tabs

If you find yourself with multiple section tabs on the **Request** screen, it's convenient to arrange them in the order that suits you best.

Simply use **drag-and-drop** to organize the tabs in the sequence that matters most to you.

## Contact automatically added to To field in new request

When creating a new request, you encounter two fields for contact information: the **Contact** field and the **To** field, both within the request. Including a contact in the **Contact** field will instantly populate the same contact in the **To** field.

## Add multiple tags at once to a request

[Tags][1] assist in grouping your various requests, making them easy to locate. If you've configured requests with multiple tags, adding several tags at once is a straightforward process.
