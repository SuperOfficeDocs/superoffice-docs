# Service 10.2.11 update

## Preview with quick edit

When you are looking through a list of request you sometimes see that you need to change som minor details on a request.

In the **preview** of the request you can **quick edit** these fields that helps you being more efficient handling requests:

* Status
* Owner
* Category

## Change tab order on Request section tabs

If you have multiple section tabs on the **request screen**, it's nice to move the tabs in the order you like.

**Drag and drop** the tabs in the rank that is important to you.

## New request will add contact to To field

Creating a **new request** you have two fields for contact info. One in the Contact field on the request and one in the To field on the request.

Adding a contact in the **Contact** -field will **automatically** add the same contact in the **To** -field.

## Add multiple tag to a request in one go

[Working with tags][1] will help you to **group** and **find** your different requests easily.

If you have set up requests with **multiple tags**, it's easy to add multiple tags in one go.
