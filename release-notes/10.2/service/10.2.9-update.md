# Service 10.2.9 update

## Add new contact from the request

When you are working with a request, you sometimes have to add new contacts and companies to SuperOffice.

To be efficient in that task, you can edit your request, and click on the **Add** button in the field of the new contact. Then you'll get the dialog **Add contact to SuperOffice** where you can add company if needed and the new contact.
