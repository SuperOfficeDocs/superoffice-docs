# Service 10.2.6 update

## Close all tabs in Requests screen

When you work with requests on a daily basis, you end up with a lot of request **tabs and lists**/selections on your Request screen.

To help you clean up (read: close all tabs) the screen, you can easily **right-click on a tab** and select one of these options:

* Close all
* Close all requests tabs
* Close all selection tabs
* Close all tabs but this (except for the tab you right clicked on)

Doing so, you have a clean "desktop" and it's easy close all the tabs you no longer will work with.

## Archive attachment on a message

Communicating with contacts you sometimes get **attachments** you want to save in SuperOffice as documents.

On the attachment in the message you have the option to archive an attachment into SuperOffice, and not just view it on a request. With a good subject on the document it's easy for both you and your colleagues to find it.

Click on the drop-down **arrow** and select **Archive**, add the correct details in the Document dialog and click **Create**.

## Search in the Find request tab gives both selections and requests

Working with requests from your contacts often has you focusing on the Request screen only. With the option to search for both requests and selections in the **Find request** tab, you have everything in hand at one place.

Click on the **Find request tab**, start to **search** and see the result contains both **requests** and **selections**.
