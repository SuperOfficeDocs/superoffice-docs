# Service 10.2.7 update

## Open/download attachments in side bar preview

To get a quick overview of a request it's very neat to use the preview in the sidebar! Sometimes that preview shows some attachments that is important to look at to get the full overview.

Just click on the arrow of the attachment and select Open/Download and you have all information available.

## Update lists clicking the !-icon

When working with lists that contains request other users also update will pretty soon need a refresh to get the changes created by others. You will see the list icon change to a blue exclamation mark.

If you click on the blue exclamation mark, the list is updated directly, and you have all the changes visible in the list.

Pretty handy to have this refresh option in the top bar instead of clicking the **Refresh** button in the bottom right footer, that off course do the same thing.

## Create system signature for Requests

When there are more than one that deals with customers it's often wanted to have a united look & feel for all outgoing communication.

To get that uniform signature for all users, just add the correct signature in the system signature settings.

Go to **Main** menu, select **Edit system signature** and add the wanted Request signature.

If you have user administrator rights, you also have the option to select or change the users request signature in the **User** screen, **Task** button.

## Change rank on contacts by drag & drop

Dealing with requests and multiple contacts is sometimes be time consuming to change and fix.

By going into **Edit** mode and the **drag & drop** the different contacts added, you can also change the contact directly linked to the request.

The request will appear in the request section tabs on both company and contact for all the contacts added in the requests.
