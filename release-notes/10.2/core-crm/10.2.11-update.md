# Core CRM 10.2.11 update

## Document editing in Local settings dialog

Using **WebTools** makes it easy for you handle your documents and files in SuperOffice. Here you have the option to select **WebTools** or **manually** upload/download files.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Google Workspace or SharePoint Documents - set it to manually.

### Browser security question when opening files

When you open and edit a document/file  in SuperOffice, your browser gives you a dialog with a security question about the file download.

To open the file you need to select the Open/Allow -button. Read more about the WebTools under [Office integrations section][1].
