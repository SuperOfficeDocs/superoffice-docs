# Core CRM 10.2.1 update

## Preferences - Default values for start-up screen

When you start your day with the same routine and want the same start up screen, go to **Preferences** > **Default values** and select the Standard startup screen that is right for you.

You can choose between **Last shown screen** or one of the different main panels.

## Batch management

When using some functions in SuperOffice, a batch job is started to finish a job like running a report, do a bulk update or an import job.

Most of the jobs you have started can be stopped if you regret starting them. Click the batch management icon in the top bar, select the job and click stop.

## Old dashboards will be removed

The old dashboards are still available, but there is a time limit on this. Access to old dashboards will be removed by the end of March 2023.

If you still want to use them and recreate them in the current Dashboard, you need to do it now.

## Document preview with metadata

Finding the correct document to attach to an email is easy when you have all the metadata for the document and a possibility to preview the actual document.

The metadata that are shown comes from the document dialog header with the title, file name, author, our.ref., company, contact, sale, and project name.
