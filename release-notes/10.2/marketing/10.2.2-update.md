# Marketing 10.2.2 update

## Email domain validation

Customers and users of Marketing can specify any from address in their mailings. This is a useful feature for users sending out mailings on behalf of their company and on behalf of their colleagues or CEO. However, not all customers and users have the knowledge of the need for correct domain configuration to ensure email deliverability.
