## Improved design on the Company card

The Company card has gotten a new design, which will improve the user experience.

The new design makes it easier to access information, and we've added the four quick buttons at the top of the Company card to make it easier to book an appointment, call a company, visit their website and calculate your route and travel time when you want to visit them.

In addition, you can now access and create projects from the Company card. And like before, you'll have access to all the contacts, activities, documents, sales, and interests.

## Improved design on the Contact card

The **Contact card** has gotten the same new design as the Company card.

In addition, you can now access and create projects from the Contact card. And like before, you'll have access to all the activities, documents, sales, and interests.
