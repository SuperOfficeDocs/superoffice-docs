# Core CRM 10.3.2 update

## Notifications - Show invitations I have declined

You can decline meetings in your diary that do not fit your schedule. If your calendar changes and you can now attend a previously declined meeting, it is simple to accept it.

To accept a declined meeting, click **Show declined meetings** in the Notification panel's footer. Then, find the meeting you can now attend, and click **Accept**.

## Dashboard - New default Requests dashboard

When managing requests, it is crucial to have an overview of your response and closing times. The default **Requests** dashboard provides this overview with various tiles displaying request status analytics.

Go to **Dashboard** and search for "request".

Here you will see an overview of your request status:

You can customize this dashboard to meet your needs by clicking **Task**, select **Add tile/Edit layout**, and choose the important tiles.

## Dashboard - New standard request tiles

To help you create an effective request dashboard, we have added new standard tiles for requests (in versions 10.3.1 and 10.3.2). See the overview below:

* Average closing time by category
* Average closing time by user
* Average response time by category
* Average response time by user
* Customers with the most open requests
* My average response time
* My average closing time
* My open requests
* My requests with passed deadline
* Open requests by priority
* Open requests by user
* Request by category
* Requests created this month
* Unassigned requests
