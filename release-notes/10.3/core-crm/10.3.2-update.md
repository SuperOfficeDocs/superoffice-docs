# Core CRM 10.3.2 update

## Notifications - Show invitations I have declined

You can decline meetings in your diary that do not fit your schedule. If your calendar changes and you can now attend a previously declined meeting, it is simple to accept it.

1. Click **Show invitations I have declined** in the Notification panel's footer.
2. Find the meeting you can now attend, and click **Accept**.

## Dashboard - New standard request tiles

We have added new standard tiles for requests in versions 10.3.1 and 10.3.2 to help you create an effective dashboard. These include:

* Average closing time by category/user
* Average response time by category/user
* Customers with the most open requests
* My average response/closing time
* My open requests and requests with passed deadline
* Open requests by priority/user
* Request by category
* Requests created this month
* Unassigned requests
