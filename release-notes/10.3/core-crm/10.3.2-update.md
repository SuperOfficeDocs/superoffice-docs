# Core CRM 10.3.2 update

## Notifications - Show invitations I have declined

You can decline meetings in your diary that do not fit your schedule. If your calendar changes and you can now attend a previously declined meeting, it is simple to accept it.

You can accept the declined meeting by clicking the link  **Show declined meetings** in the footer over Notifications pop out panel, find the one meeting you can now attend, and click **Accept**.

## Dashboard - New default Requests dashboard

When managing Service and requests, it is crucial to have an overview of your response and closing times. The default **Requests** dashboard provides this overview with various request tiles displaying your request status analytics.

Go to **Dashboard** and search for "request".
