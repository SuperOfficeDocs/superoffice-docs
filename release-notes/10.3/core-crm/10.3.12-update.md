# Core CRM 10.3.12 update

## User preferences - search option

To fine-tune your SuperOffice, you have probably seen the **Preferences** dialog, and seen all the different preferences you can set.

The preferences are organised in **groupes**, for easier settings of the different areas.

With the **search field** on top, you can also search for a specific preference, as long as you know parts of the name. That is very convenient when you know you do want to search for something with "follow-up", but not sure which group or the whole title.
