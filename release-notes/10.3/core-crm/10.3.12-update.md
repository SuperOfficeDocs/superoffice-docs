# Core CRM 10.3.12 update

## User preferences - search option

To fine-tune your SuperOffice, you have probably seen the **Preferences** dialog, and seen all the different preferences you can set.

The preferences are organised in **groups**, for easier settings of the different areas.

With the **search field** on top, you can also search for a specific preference, as long as you know parts of the name. That is very convenient when you know you do want to search for something with "follow-up", but not sure which group or the whole title.

## Project and Sale - Add members

You have an option to add **stakeholders** to your sale, the persons that are important to get the sale thru. As for **project members**, those are important for a project and getting an overview of who will attend an event and of course other scenarios.

To add these members, you use the same functionality adding participants to **follow-ups**. You see buttons for favourites, user groups, company and search, and you can multiselect for easy adding.

By **selecting all** you can also update function and comment on all persons. You can off course update one by one and it's easy to see the settings in the list.
