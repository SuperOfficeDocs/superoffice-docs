# Core CRM 10.3.1 update

## Dashboard - New standard request tiles

To help you create an effective request dashboard, we have added new standard tiles:

* My average response time (1x1)
* My average closing time (1x1)
* Average response time by category (2x2)
* Average closing time by category (2x2)
* Average closing time by user (2x2)
* Requests created this month (2x2)

You will find them under the standard tiles for request when you select to **Add tile/edit layout**.
