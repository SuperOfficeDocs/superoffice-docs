# Core CRM 10.3.1 update

## Dashboard - New Requests dashboard and tiles

When you are working with Service and requests, it's often needed to have some overview of your response and closing time. With the new default dashboard for **Requests** you get that overview with multiple request tiles to show you analytics for your request status.

Go to Dashboard and search for Requests:

And get the overview of your request status.

## Dashboard - New standard Requests tiles

To make sure you have the tools to create a good request dashboard, there are added new standard tiles:

* My average response time (1x1)
* My average closing time (1x1)
* Average response time by category (2x2)
* Average closing time by category (2x2)
* Average closing time by user (2x2)
* Requests created this month (2x2)
