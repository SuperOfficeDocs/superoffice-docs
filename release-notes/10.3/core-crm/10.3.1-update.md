# Core CRM 10.3.1 update

## Dashboard - New default Requests dashboard

When managing Service and requests, it is crucial to have an overview of your response and closing times. The new default **Requests** dashboard provides this overview with various request tiles displaying your request status analytics.

Here’s how to access it:

1. Go to **Dashboard**.
2. Search for "Requests".
