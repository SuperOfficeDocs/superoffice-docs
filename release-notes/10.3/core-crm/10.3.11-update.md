# Core CRM 10.3.11 update

## Document dialog - Clean and intuitive

The Document dialog has the same look and feel as the **Follow-up dialog**, making it more **intuitive** for you to select the title, template type, company/contact, sale, and project, just as you would in the Follow-up dialog.

Marking a document as a **favourite** is simple - just click the star icon, and you’ll easily find it again in the My favourites side panel.

The **top bar** in the Document dialog includes the following fields:

* **Language**: A drop-down menu displaying all available languages for the selected document template (the default is based on your preferences).
* **Date**: You can set the date to something other than today’s, but it can only be modified when the document is first created.
* **Visible for**: This field determines visibility - either to everyone, your user groups, or just yourself. The default setting is taken from your preferences.

Did you know that you can **drag and drop** a document from your file explorer directly into the **Upload file** section of the Document dialog?

The [Document dialog][3] can be customised using the **Screen designer** in Settings and Maintenance. However, note that some fields are locked for customisation.

## Selection - Task for Print selection

Have you ever needed to **print** a list of specific content from SuperOffice CRM?

With the **Print selection** feature under Task in Selection, you can easily print any selection you have. Simply configure the **first five columns** you want to include, and you're all set. If you need to print more data, we recommend using our [Export to Excel][2] functionality instead.

Additionally, if you've set up **grouping** or **column calculations** in your selection, these will also appear in the report.

**PS!** You can also print the main screen with the section tab by selecting the Print option from Task.

> [!NOTE]
> **Important:** The **Reporter** button in the navigator will be removed for all Online customers as of 01.12.2024. Read more in our [End of Life overview][1].
