# Core CRM 10.3.11 update

## Document dialog - Clean and intuitive

The Document dialog now shares the same clean, familiar design as the **Follow-up dialog**, making it **intuitive** to select options like title, template type, company/contact, sale, and project – just as you would when setting up a follow-up.

Marking a document as a **favourite** is simple - just click the star icon, and you'll easily find it again in the My favourites side panel.

The **top bar** in the Document dialog includes these fields:

* **Language**: Choose from available languages for the selected document template (your default is set based on preferences).
* **Date**: Select a date other than today's if needed. This option is only editable when the document is first created.
* **Visible for**: Control visibility settings – visible to everyone, specific user groups, or only yourself, with the default based on your preferences.

Did you know? You can **drag and drop** a document from your file explorer directly into the **Upload file** section of the Document dialog?

The [Document dialog][3] can be customised using the **Screen designer** in Settings and Maintenance, though some fields are fixed and cannot be modified.

## Selection - Task for print selection

Need to **print** specific data from SuperOffice CRM?

The **Print Selection** option under Task in Selection makes it easy to print any selection you choose. Simply set up the **first five columns** you want included, and you're ready to go. For larger data sets, we recommend using the [Export to Excel][2] feature instead.

If you've applied **grouping** or **column calculations** to your selection, these settings will appear in the printed report, too.

You can also print the main screen, including the section tab, by selecting **Print** from the **Task** menu.

> [!CAUTION]
> The **Reporter** button in the navigator will be removed for all Online customers as of 04.12.2024. Read more in our [End of Life overview][1].
