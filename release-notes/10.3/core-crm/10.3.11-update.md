# Core CRM 10.3.11 update

## Document - Clean and intuitive

The Document dialog have the same look and feel as the follow-up dialog. This is to make it more **intuitive** for you, as a user, to select the title, template type, company/contact, sale and project in the document dialog, just as you do in the follow-up dialog.

It's also very easy to set the document as a **favourite** with the star, so you can quickly find it again in the My favourites side panel.

And you did know, off course, that you can **drag & drop** a document from your file explorer and into section for **Upload file** in the document dialog!

## Selection - Task for print content from selection

Have you ever needed to **print** out a list of a certain content from SuperOffice CRM?

Using the print functionality from Tasks in Selection, you can print whatever the selection you have. Set up the five - **5** - first columns you want to print and there you go. If you do want to print out more data, use our [Export to Excel][2] functionality instead.

And, if you have set up a **column calculation** in your selection, this calculation are also shown in the report.

**PS!** You can also print a main screen with selected content from the section tab by selecting the Print option from Task.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note! The **Reporter** and **Reporter Studio** have an **end of life** set to 07.01.2025. Read more in our [End of life overview][1].
