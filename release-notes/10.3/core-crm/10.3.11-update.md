# Core CRM 10.3.11 update

## Document dialog - Clean and intuitive

The Document dialog have the same look and feel as the **follow-up dialog**. This is to make it more **intuitive** for you, as a user, to select the title, template type, company/contact, sale and project in the document dialog, just as you do in the follow-up dialog.

It's very easy to set the document as a **favourite** with the star, so you can quickly find it again in the My favourites side panel.

The **top bar** in the document dialog contains fields for:

* **Language**, a drop down that shows all the languages you have for the selected document template (the default will be the default language you have selected in your Preferences).
* The **Date** can be set to something else that todays date. It can only be changed when created.
* The **Visible for** field is either all, your user groups or you, it select the default settings from your Preferences.

And you did know, off course, that you can **drag & drop** a document from your file explorer and into section for **Upload file** in the document dialog!

The [document dialog][3] can be customized in the **Screen designer** in Settings and maintenance.

## Selection - Task for Print selection

Have you ever needed to **print** out a list of a certain content from SuperOffice CRM?

Using the print functionality from Tasks in Selection, you can print whatever the selection you have. Set up the **five first columns** you want to print and there you go. If you do want to print out more data, use our [Export to Excel][2] functionality instead.

And, if you have set up grouping and/or a **column calculation** in your selection, this will also show in the report.

**PS!** You can also print a main screen with section tab by selecting the Print option from Task.

> **Please note!** The **Reporter** button will be removed for all Online customers from 01.12.2024. Read more in our [End of life overview][1].
