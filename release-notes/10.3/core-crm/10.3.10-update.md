# Core CRM 10.3.10 update

## Selection - Task for print labels

Printing labels may not be a frequent task, but when the holidays are approaching, you might want to send cards to show appreciation to your customers.

Label printing has shifted from using PDF print to browser print.

To create address labels, first select the companies you want to include. Then, click the **Task** button, choose **Print labels**, and select your preferred label **layout**. The different layouts are configurable and accessible to all users in the company, so fine-tune them to fit your needs.

The **label layout settings** will appear in the information dialog. Make sure to adjust your **browser print** settings—such as scale, margins, orientation, and paper size—to match these specifications.Just adjust the **print settings** to ensure the addresses **fit correctly** within the label area, so they print neatly without overlapping.

> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind that if you use browser print for other items, you may need to **re-adjust the label alignment each time** to maintain accuracy.
