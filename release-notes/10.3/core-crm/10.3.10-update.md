# Core CRM 10.3.10 update

## Selection - Task for print labels

You may not need to print labels often, but when Christmas is approaching, you might want to send cards to show appreciation to your customers.

To easily create address labels, create a selection of all wanted companies, click the Task button and select **Print labels**, and choose the wanted label **layout**.

Setting up **browser print** is straightforward. Just adjust the **print settings** to ensure the addresses **fit correctly** within the label area; otherwise, things might get a bit messy on the label sheet.
