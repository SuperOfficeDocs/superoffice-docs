# Core CRM 10.3.10 update

## Selection - Task for print labels

You may not need to print labels that often, but when Christmas is approaching, you might want to send cards to show appreciation to your customers.

To easily create address labels, create a selection of all wanted companies, click the **Task** button and select **Print labels**, and choose the wanted label **layout**. (The different layouts are configurable and accessible for all users in the company, so fine-tune them to fit your needs.)

The **label layout settings** are repeated in the information dialog, and you need to set up your **browser print** accordingly; correct scale, margins, orientation and paper size. Just adjust the **print settings** to ensure the addresses **fit correctly** within the label area; otherwise, things might get a bit messy on the printed label sheet.

> [!TIP]
> Remember, if you're printing other items using browser print, you may need to **align** the printing of labels each time to ensure accuracy.

PS! This is a changed functionality, from using pdf print to **browser print**.
