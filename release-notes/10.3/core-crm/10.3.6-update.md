# Core CRM 10.3.6 update

## Follow-up - New and improved Follow-up dialog

The **Follow-up** dialog, also known as the Appointment dialog, has undergone a complete makeover. Rest assured, you can still recognize and work efficiently with it.

The redesign involved extensive user feedback, evaluating both the good and the bad, resulting in the new Follow-up dialog.

### Description split into Title, Agenda, and Internal notes

The **Title** field is now separate from the follow-up description, which is split into two tabs: **Agenda** and **Internal notes**.

* The agenda text is visible to all, including external invitees via email and iCal.
* The internal notes are only visible for you and your colleagues.

### Add attendees

Adding multiple participants is easy. Just type in the **Add attendees** field, select from the search results, and hit **Enter** to add the person as an attendee.

You can off course also use the dropdown to select from favorites, associates and user groups, companies and contacts, sales, or projects.

### Add attendees just by their email address

Now you can add a participant who is not in your SuperOffice CRM by entering their **email address** in the attendees field and hitting **Enter**.

And you get a clear **overview** of all attendees showing who has been **invited**, who has accepted or declined, and any **conflicts**. Just click the sections for detailed views.

### Check availability of the attendees

If you have multiple **internal attendees**, and you see that your meeting has some conflicts, use the **check availability** feature to pick a better time for your meeting:

* Change the date in **Selected date and time** to find a better match.
* **Drag-and-drop** to a new time in the scheduler (marked in light green).
* Navigate to the **Next** period if needed (use the arrows).

### Control the contents of the invitation email

For meetings with **external attendees**, you can control and edit the invitation email before sending it. If you choose to send an email, it opens for you to **edit and add** content as needed before sending and saving the follow-up.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a toggle to send the invitation email to all attendees. You can't select specific individuals to receive the email.

These are just a **few highlights** of the changes. Learn more about the new [Follow-up dialog][1] in our **Learn | Docs**.
