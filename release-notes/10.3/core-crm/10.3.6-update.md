# Core CRM 10.3.6 update

## Follow-up - new generation of the follow-up dialog

The **Follow-up** dialog (also know as the Appointment dialog), has been through a total makeover. But rest assure, you can still recognise the dialog and **work efficiently** with it.

The follow-up dialog has been through a lot of scrutiny before it was redesigned. Users has been invited to give feedback on the good and the bad, and this has been evaluated and the result is the new follow-up dialog.

### Description has been split into Title, Agenda and Internal notes

The field for **Title** is separated from the description of the follow-up. And the description field is split into two tabs: **Agenda** and **Internal notes**.

The Agenda text is for all to see, also the external invited persons gets it in their e-mail and iCal. But the Internal notes is **only visible** for you and your colleagues.

As for the text options, you can now **format the text** AND you can write as much as you want!

### Add attendees

With a meeting with multiple participants, it's nice to know that it's pretty easy to add them. Just write in the **Add attendees** field, and you will get a search result and if the first selected is the correct one, just hit **Enter** and the person is added as an attendee.

You can off course open the drop down and select one of the different tabs in the menu. You can choose between your favourites, associates and user groups, companies and contacts, sales or projects.

### Participants added just by the e-mail address

There is an option to add a participant that is not in your SuperOffice CRM, you just enter the **e-mail address** in the attendees field and hit **Enter**.

And you get a pretty nice **overview** of all the participants where you can see how many that has been **invited**, how many that has said **yes**, said **no**, and if there are any **conflicts** to your meeting. Just click the different sections and you'll get the exact overview.

### Check availability on the attendees

If you have multiple internal attendees, and you see that your meeting has some conflicts, it's a good idea to check if you can pick a better time for your meeting.

Click the link for Check availability and here you have different options to find a better time:

* Change the date in **Selected date and time** and see if it's a better match
* **Drag&drop** the new time in the scheduler (it's marked with light green)
* You can also go to the **Next** period if it's not any good time (use the arrows)

### Control of the content of the invitation e-mail

When you have **external participants** to your meeting, you most often want to control the look and the content of that e-mail, and not just send out the e-mail automatically.

If you have selected that an e-mail should be sent to the participants, the e-mail is opened and you **can edit and add** whatever you like in the e-mail before sending it and saving the follow-up.

> [!NOTE]
> It’s an on/off toggle for sending the invitation e-mail to all attendees. You can't' select specific individuals to receive the invitation e-mail.
