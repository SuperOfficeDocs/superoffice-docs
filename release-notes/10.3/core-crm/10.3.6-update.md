# Core CRM 10.3.6 update

## Follow-up - new generation of the follow-up dialog

The **Follow-up** dialog (most users also know it as the Appointment dialog), has been through a total makeover. But rest assure, you still can recognise the dialog and **work efficiently** with it.

The follow-up dialog has been through a lot of scrutiny before it was redesigned. Users has been invited to give feedback on the good and the bad, and this has been evaluated and the result is shown in the new follow-up dialog.

### Title field separated with description

The field for **Title** is separated with the description of the follow-up. And the description field is also split up in two tabs: **Agenda** and **Internal notes**.

The Agenda text is for all to see, also the external invited persons. But the Internal notes is **only visible** for you and your colleagues.

As for the text options, you can now **format the text** AND you can write as much as you want!

### Participants added just by the e-mail address

There is an option to add a participant that is not in your SuperOffice CRM, you just enter the **e-mail address** in the attendees field and hit **Enter**.

And you get a pretty nice **overview** of all the participants where you can see how many that has been **invited**, how many that has said **yes**, said *no*, and if there are any **conflicts** to your meeting. Just click the different sections and you'll get the exact overview.

### Control of the invitation e-mail

When you have **external participants** to your meeting, you most often want to control the look and the content of that e-mail, and not just send out the e-mail automatically.

If you have selected that an e-mail should be sent to the participants, the e-mail is opened and you **can edit and add** whatever you like in the e-mail before sending it.

You can, however, **not** any longer **select** the persons that should get the invitation e-mail and not, it's all or none that get the invitation by e-mail.
