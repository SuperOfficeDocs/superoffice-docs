# Core CRM 10.3.9 update

## Column calculations on section tabs and selections

Have you wondered if it's possible to perform **calculations** on selected **columns** in your section tabs or selections?

**Yes**, it is! Simply go to the ![icon][img4] settings icon, select the **∑ Sum** tab, and choose the desired **calculation** for the relevant columns. Don't forget to add the columns you want to include in the calculations.

If you wish to perform group calculations, make sure to **enable grouping** as well.

This functionality gives you great control over your **selections**, allowing you to group and organise your data to **identify trends** and gain a **clear overview**. It's more like a report system if you like.

You also have the option to select a **chart** to your selection, although some of us still prefer to view the "Excel-like" sheet behind the charts.

## Columns/fields - Base currency and currency options

For those that use currency on sales, it's important to make sure the sums are correct and aligned with the same currency amount.

We do have some columns/fields that will make this a little easier, and that is Amount ("BaseCurrency") and Weighted amount ("BaseCurrency").

Use the currency to group the sales, or use the base currency columns with calculations, to get that overview you need.
