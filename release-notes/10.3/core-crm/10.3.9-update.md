# Core CRM 10.3.9 update

## Section tabs - Field/column calculations

So you probably been wondering if you can get calculations on selected **columns** in your section tabs or selections?

**Yes**, you can! Just go to the settings and the **∑ Sum** tab and select the wanted **calculation** for the different columns. Remember to add the columns you want to do calculations on.

If you want to get group calculations, you also need to **enable grouping**.

With this functionality, you have so much power in your **selections**, to group and organise your data to **see trends** and get a **good overview** of your data. You do have the possibility to select a **chart** to your selection as well, but some of us do like to see the "excel" sheet behind the charts.
