# Settings and maintenance 10.3.7 update

## CRMScript - Trigger dialog with formatted text

When creating trigger script it is possible to **open a dialog** to display information to user or gather input. It is now even possible to display text with **simple formatting** to add bullet points, html links and other formatting options.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not full Markdown but a "lite" version.
