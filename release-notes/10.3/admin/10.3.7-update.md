# Settings and maintenance 10.3.7 update

## CRMScript - Trigger dialog with formatted text

When creating CRMScripts including triggers, you can write a text in a dialog that appears for the users.

You can fine tune the information even more with the **simple formatting** possibility you have options to add bullet points, html links and other formatting options.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not full Markdown but a "lite" version.
