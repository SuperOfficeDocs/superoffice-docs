# Settings and maintenance 10.3.2 update

## Requests - Add and customize request types

With multiple [request types][1], you can streamline your work based on customer needs.

[Add a request type][2] and select an **icon** to differentiate the types, the **available statuses**, the **default status**, and other settings. The added types will appear as the first field in the preview pane and at top of the **properties sidebar** of the (new) Requests screen.

## Screen designer for Requests - Assign layouts to Request types or User group

To make the working cycle for requests as smooth as possible for the users, you should have customised the layout for requests as good as possible. If there are different types of requests like normal problem-solving requests and invoice requests there is a good starting point to set this up.

In **Screen designer** for **Requests layout** you need to choose the **assigned layout** method, and there you have two options: **User group** or **Request types**. If you choose **User group**, the different layouts for requests will be dedicated to the user group the assigned user belongs to. With the option to select **Request types**, you can choose the layouts based on your request types (added under Requests).

In this example a request type for **Invoice request** is added, and in this layout it's important to add the **Invoice number** to be shown in the **Properties sidebar** of the request ([a field is added][2] for invoice on the request table in **System design**).
