# Settings and maintenance 10.3.1 update

## Web panel setting for reload on navigation

Using web panels in SuperOffice often help you as a user to be more efficient and get access to important information from other parts of your company or industry.

**For example:** To make the web panels fine tuned to the main panel you are on, you often add **template variables** to link them together. This will result a reload of the web panel each time you change the company for example.

If the web panel is *not* linked to a specific company, you probably do not want to reload the web page each time you show a different company. Set the check box **ON** for the **Do not reload content on main card navigation** to prevent this reload, less data are loaded, and that means better performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the do-not-reload option if your content does not depend on selected data in the main card. Activating this setting will lead to less data loaded.
