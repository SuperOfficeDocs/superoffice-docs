# Settings and maintenance 10.3.1 update

## Web panel setting for reload on navigation

Using web panels in SuperOffice often help you as an user to be more efficient and get access to important information from other parts of your company or industry.

**For example:** To make the web panels fine tuned to the main panel you are on, you often add **template variables** to link them together. This will result a reload of the web panel each time you change the company for example.

If the web panel is *not* linked to a specific company, you probably do not want to reload the web page each time you show a different company. Set the check box **ON** for the **Do not reload content on main card navigation** to prevent this reload, less data are loaded, and that means better performance.

> Use this option if your content does not depend on selected data in main card. Activating this setting will lead to less data loaded.
