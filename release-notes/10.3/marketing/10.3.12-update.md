# Marketing 10.3.12 update

## Flow - Track links using form with variables

Imagine a seamless way to track every important link, reliably and without disruption. With our enhanced tracked links including "Open form" tracking, users can easily define and monitor the links they care about most. No more frustration with lost tracking data when e-mails are edited — simply create any essential link as a tracked link, and every click becomes actionable in Flow triggers and settings.

For Form mailing links with variables, we’re have a powerful, user-friendly link dialogue: a dedicated option to set form URLs as tracked links. This gives users the freedom to track specific form links with precision, adding valuable control over each click’s data. Effortless tracking, enhanced insights, and complete flexibility—all in one streamlined experience!
