# Marketing 10.3.12 update

## Tracked links - Open form with variables

In your mailings, you might want to track links that open a form. To do this, create a new **tracked link**, select the response type **Open form** in the Link properties, choose the desired form, and add the variables you want to be pre-filled. **Pre-filled variables** make it easier for the recipient to submit the form, as details like their name, email address, and other information are already filled in.

To **act on link clicks in Flows**, you need to use tracked links. You can either use a tracked link available for all mailings or create a specific tracked link for an individual mailing. These tracked links can then be used in triggers, splits, or wait actions within Flows.

A tracked link can also be used as a **split action** to respond to actions taken in an earlier mailing.
