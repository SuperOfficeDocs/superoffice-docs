# Marketing 10.3.12 update

## Tracked links - Open form with variables

In mailing, you may wish to track links that opens a form. To do this, create a new tracked link, select the response type **Open form** in the Link properties, choose the desired **form**, and then add the **variables** you want to be **pre-filled**. By using pre-filled variables, you make it easier for the recipient to submit the form, as details like name, email address, and more are already filled in.

To be able to **act upon link clicks in Flows**, you need to use tracked links. Either a tracked link available for all mailings or create a tracked link for a specific mailing. A tracked link can then be used in triggers, splits or wait actions in Flows.

A tracked link can be used as a **split action** where you act upon actions in the earlier mailing.
