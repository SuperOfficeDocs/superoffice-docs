# Marketing 10.3.12 update

## Tracked links - Open form with variables

In mailing, you may wish to add links that open a form. To do this, create a new tracked link, select the response type **Open form** in the Link properties, choose the desired **form**, and then add the **variables** you want to be **pre-filled**. By using pre-filled variables, you make it easier for the recipient to submit the form, as details like name, email address, and more are already filled in.

To be able to track links in flows, you need to use **tracked links**, either a global link or create a tracked link inside the mailing.

A tracked link can be used as a **split action** where you act upon actions in the earlier mailing.

> [!NOTE]
> For Flows we will require that links needs to be defined as tracked links (normal or global) to be able to act upon them. This means "normal" links added to buttons or links in the email will not show up in trigger settings, splits etc in Flows. If a user would like to act upon link clicks, they will have to create a tracked link and add it to the step settings in Flows.
