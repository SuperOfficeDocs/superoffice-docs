## Marketing Flows - Automation with flows with multiple mailings and other steps

Did you know with Marketing Premium license, you have access to our **marketing automation** functionality?

Have you ever thought about a mailing could **spark a new mailing**, that you could first send one mailing, and after a certain time, a new mailing could be sent - **automatically**?!

With this tool you can actually do so much more than just that! There are a lot of **different steps** you can add to your flow and you can even [split the flow][3] when a certain button or pushed or another happening.

## Mailing - Audit check on email mailing

There's a lot to think about and many settings to remember when creating an email mailing. That's where a little guidance can help catch anything you might have missed.

The **Audit** tab flags any overlooked settings for you. In this example, it identifies:

* **Missing preheader text:** includes a tip directing you to **Body - E-mail Settings** to resolve it.

* **Button links are empty:** click the **arrow** button to quickly jump to the issue and fix it.

It's reassuring to know you haven't overlooked any vital steps before sending your email.

## Mailing - Validation of preheader text in email mailing

The **Preheader text** can be easy to overlook since it's tucked away under the **Body** tab, where you typically don't change stuff as frequently. But if you see a warning in the **Audit** tab, it serves as a helpful reminder to update this detail.

To update the preheader text, go to the **Body** tab and find the **E-mail Settings** section. This text will appear right after the **subject line** in the inbox.
