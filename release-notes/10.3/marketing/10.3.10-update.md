# Marketing 10.3.10 update

## Mailing - Audit check on the e-mail mailing

Thereâ€™s a lot to think about and many settings to remember when creating an e-mail mailing. Itâ€™s helpful to have some guidance on what you may have missed or forgotten.

The **Audit** tab highlights any settings youâ€™ve overlooked! In this example, there are:

* **Missing preheader text** â€“ with a tip on where to find it, which is in **Body - E-mail Settings**.
* **Button links are empty** â€“ you can click the **arrow** button to *Take me to fix* the issue.

Itâ€™s reassuring to know you havenâ€™t missed any vital steps before sending the e-mail mailing ðŸ˜….

## Mailing - Validation of preheader text of e-mail mailing

The **Preheader text** is easily forgotten as itâ€™s located under the **Body** tab, where you typically donâ€™t make many changes. However, when you see a warning in the **Audit** tab, itâ€™s much easier to notice that youâ€™ve forgotten to add the preheader text.

Go to the **Body** tab and **E-mail Settings** section to change the preheader text, which appears after the **subject line** in the inbox.
