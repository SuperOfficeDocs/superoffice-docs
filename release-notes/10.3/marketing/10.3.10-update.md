# Marketing 10.3.10 update

## Mailing - Audit check on email mailing

There's a lot to think about and many settings to remember when creating an email mailing. That's where a little guidance can help catch anything you might have missed.

The **Audit** tab flags any overlooked settings for you. In this example, it identifies:

* **Missing preheader text:** includes a tip directing you to **Body - E-mail Settings** to resolve it.

* **Button links are empty:** click the **arrow** button to quickly jump to the issue and fix it.

It's reassuring to know you haven't overlooked any vital steps before sending your email.

## Mailing - Validation of preheader text in email mailing

The **Preheader text** can be easy to overlook since it's tucked away under the **Body** tab, where you typically don't change stuff as frequently. But if you see a warning in the **Audit** tab, it serves as a helpful reminder to update this detail.

To update the preheader text, go to the **Body** tab and find the **E-mail Settings** section. This text will appear right after the **subject line** in the inbox.
