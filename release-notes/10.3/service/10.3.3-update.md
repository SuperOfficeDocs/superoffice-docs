* **Preview** with a **single click**: Confirm relevance quickly.
* **Download** with a **double click**: Efficiency download the one attachment.

Still want options? Click the **arrow** for the options: Preview, Download or Archive. Or you can simply click the **Download all** button to create a zip file.
