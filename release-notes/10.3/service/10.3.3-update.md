# Service 10.3.3 update

## Request - Simplify Attachment Handling

When dealing with requests, attachments often hold the key to crucial information. Now, streamline your workflow:

* **Preview** with a **single click**: Confirm relevance swiftly.
* **Download** with a **double click**: No fuss, just efficiency and get the attachment downloaded.

Still want options? Click the arrow for the options or grab all attachments in a zip file. But remember, less clicking means more productivity!
