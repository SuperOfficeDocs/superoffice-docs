# Service 10.3.3 update

## Request - simplify attachment handling

When dealing with requests, attachments often hold the key to crucial information. Now, streamline your workflow:

* **Preview** with a **single click**: Confirm relevance quickly.
* **Download** with a **double click**: Efficiently download the one attachment.

Still want options? Click the **arrow** for the options: Preview, Download, or Archive. Or, click the **Download all** button to create a zip file.
