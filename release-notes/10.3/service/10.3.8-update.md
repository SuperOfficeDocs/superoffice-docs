# Service 10.3.8 update

## Requests - Get next in queue including own open requests

When you use the **Get next in queue** option , you will always follow your company's settings on the **deadline**, your status **queue**, the **category** you are in, and **unassigned** requests. So together with these settings, your **own open requests** are also added to that queue.

This will make the picking of requests more fair for your customers, and no requests should be forgotten. Just remember to update your **Request preferences**.

## Request type - Reply/forwarding settings

Do you get a **double signature** when you reply to an existing request? Maybe you have duplicate settings, which adds your personal signature together with the **signature settings** for the request type.

For a **Request type** there are several settings for New request and Reply/forwarding settings. Add the correct **Exclude signature** setting for new, reply and forward, and you have full control of how the messages to your customers should look like.
