# Service 10.3.5 update

## Request types - Fine tuning of requests for different types

To make the use of request types more versatile you can enable some different settings for each request types.

To be able to add the request types to the **+New** menu in SuperOffice CRM, just click ON the Show in new check box.

Some request types should also only be available for some user groups, and with the **Visible for** option you can set just that.

You also have Yes/No settings for:

* Exclude signature
* Exclude email recipients
* External access level as default

With these different settings you can fine-tune your request types. For example a request type that is only for internals, where a signature just takes up room in the cloud storage, so you want to skip that. Or to be able to start off with a request, where you don't need to add an e-mail address.
