# Service 10.3.5 update

## Request types - Fine tuning of requests for different types

To enhance the versatility of request types, you can configure settings specific to each type.

To add request types to the **+New** menu in SuperOffice CRM, simply toggle the **Show in New** checkbox to ON.

Some request types may need to be restricted to specific user groups. With the **Visible for** option, you can easily manage this.

You also have Yes/No settings for:

* Exclude signature
* Exclude email recipients
* External access level as default

These settings allow you to customize your request types precisely. For instance, you might have a request type exclusively for internal use, where including a signature is unnecessary and only takes up cloud storage space. Or, you may want to streamline the process by starting a request without needing to add an email address.
