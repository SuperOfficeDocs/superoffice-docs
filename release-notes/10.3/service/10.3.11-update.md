# Service 10.3.11 update

## System preference - Unsafe file types

As a security measure, certain file types are now blocked by default from being uploaded as external documents in Service. You can define or adjust these blocked file extensions in Settings and maintenance under **Preferences** > **System** > **Unsafe file types**.

File extensions considered unsafe by default:

[!include[List of unsafe file types](../../../common/includes/unsafe-file-extensions.md)]

If you need to allow uploads of any of these types, such as **js**, you can update the system preference to still block the remaining types: `bat, cmd, com, dll, exe, lnk, msi, ocx, php, ps1, scr, vbs`.

After setting a system preference, **flush/refresh the caches** in Service by running `action=flush`:

```https

```
