# Service 10.3.11 update

## System Preference - Unsafe Filetypes

As a security measure it is no longer allowed, by default, to upload files of specific types as `External Documents` in Service.
Blocked file extensions can be defined/adjusted under **System Preference** -> **Unsafe File Types**.

File Extensions by default considered unsafe:

| File Extension |
|----------------|
| msi            |
| exe            |
| com            |
| bat            |
| cmd            |
| ps1            |
| dll            |
| scr            |
| ocx            |
| vbs            |
| lnk            |
| php            |
| js             |

If you need to upload files of any of these types, for example js, the `System Preference` needs to be defined to still block `msi,exe,com,bat,cmd,ps1,dll,scr,ocx,vbs,lnk,php,js`.
After setting a `System Preference` it is required to flush/refresh the caches in Service by running action=flush:
`https://{{environment}}.superoffice.com/{{tenant}}/CS/scripts/ajax.fcgi?action=flush`
