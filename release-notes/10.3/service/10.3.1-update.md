# Service 10.3.1 update

## Right click to take ownership of request(s)

Working with requests will give you access to it on several places. Go to a **company** and select the Requests section tab, or find the same **Request** section tab on **Contact**, **Sale**, **Project** and **Selection**. You will off course also see a list of requests on Requests. What I'm trying to say, is that Requests can be found in multiple places in SuperOffice CRM.

With the context menu, you can from anywhere in SuperOffice take **ownership** to a request, just right click and select **Accept** and the **Owner** field is set to you, and added to your list. If you want to take ownership to several requests, just mark them and select Accept in the context menu.

## Show Company SAINT status monitor on the Request screen

Using SAINT monitors is a good incentive to catch for example companies you are loosing contact with. Adding a status monitor with an image, will give your users an instant indication the company on how to proceed with further action.

This same indication will also show on a request connected to the company with the status monitor on. This is very good for all your users and will help you to keep your companies/customers happy.
