# Service 10.3.1 update

## Right-click to take ownership of requests

Requests in SuperOffice CRM can be accessed from various locations such as **Company**, **Contact**, **Sale**, **Project**, and **Selection** tabs. You can also find them listed under Requests.

To take ownership of a request:

1. Right-click on the request.
2. Select **Accept** from the context menu.

The **Owner** field will be updated to your name, and the request will be added to your list. To take ownership of multiple requests, simply select them and choose **Accept** from the context menu.

## Show SAINT status monitor on Requests screen

SAINT monitors are useful for tracking companies you may be losing contact with. Adding a status monitor with an image provides an instant visual cue for further action.

This status monitor will also appear on any request linked to the company. This feature is beneficial for all users and aids in maintaining customer satisfaction.
