# Service 10.3.6 update

## Request - Send comment to email recipients

When working with a request and adding an internal comment, you might realize that the **comment** should be sent to someone via email. What can you do?

Simply click the **@-button** in the footer. The **email recipients** section will appear, allowing you to add the email addresses of those you want to send the comment to.
