## Request types - to get efficient support

With the option to have multiple [request types][3], you can streamline your work based on customer needs.

The fields displayed on the **Request properties** sidebar can vary based on your configuration of the [request layout][1] in the **Screen designer**.

For example, if you frequently receive invoice-related requests, consider [adding a request type][4] with a customized layout, including a designated field for invoice numbers. This approach enhances efficiency when handling such requests.
