# Service 10.3.2 update

## Request types - to get efficient support

With the option to have multiple [request types][3], you can streamline your work depending on your customers and incoming requests. The fields showing on the Request properties sidebar might then vary depending on your setup of the [Request layout][1] in your **Screen designer**.

If you get several requests regarding invoices, it's a good idea to create a [request type][1] for this and a specific request layout that includes a field for invoice number, and doing so you can work more efficient with these types of requests.

It's easy to search for a specific invoice number and also get an overview in [**Dashboards**][2] on how many requests for a specific type you have.
