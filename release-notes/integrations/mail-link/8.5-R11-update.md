## Mail Link – Support for predefined email templates

It is possible to create an **email as a template** inside Settings and maintenance.

The Mail Link will ensure that any email template that is available for a user inside SuperOffice CRM will also be available as template options directly from within their Outlook.

Inside Outlook, a new button will appear named **SuperOffice Message** that directly accesses and opens templates as a new mail.

When selecting one of these templates, the content will appear in a new mail, allowing you to fetch recipients from SuperOffice CRM and send.

The email subject field and signature will follow that specified in your email template.

The mail will be archived in SuperOffice if you have activated the archive button in Outlook when sending your mail.
