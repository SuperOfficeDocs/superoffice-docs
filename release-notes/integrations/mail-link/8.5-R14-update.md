# Office integrations 8.5 R14 update

## Mail Link – Support for incoming and outgoing invitations from external

Earlier this year we released SuperOffice 8.5 R11 which contained pre-defined email templates for Online users of SuperOffice CRM. These pre-defined email templates are also available for Onsite users.

When meeting invitations arrive and are accepted via your inbox, these will also be available in your Outlook calendar.

To enjoy a full synchronization between your SuperOffice diary and Outlook calendar, the best option is to use the Synchronizer for SuperOffice add-on. When using this add-on, a number of features in the SuperOffice invitation dialog are automatically switched off to avoid duplications.

If you do not use the Synchronizer for SuperOffice add-on or in the case where you are using the SuperOffice inbox primarily or in combination with your Outlook Mail Link, incoming and outgoing invitations from external people are now supported.

With SuperOffice 8.5 R14 you can send and receive invitations from both internal and external people. Which means you only have to save and accept your meetings once.
