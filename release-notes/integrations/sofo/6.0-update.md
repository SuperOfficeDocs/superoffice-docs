# SuperOffice for Outlook 6.0 update

## Action required

Microsoft has introduced enhanced security measures for accessing email and calendar data. To ensure continued use of the SuperOffice for Outlook add-in, a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator must authorise the add-in and grant permissions (consent) on behalf of all users.

For detailed instructions, visit the SuperOffice for Outlook [authorisation guide][1].
