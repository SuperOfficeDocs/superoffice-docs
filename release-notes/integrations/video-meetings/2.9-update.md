# Video Meetings 2.9 update

## Set configurations - Prefer direct link to Microsoft Teams

Setting up your preferred meeting service provider is quick and simple, and it makes managing your video meetings much easier.

If you use Microsoft Teams, you'll find a check box called "Prefer direct Microsoft Teams link" in **Settings and maintenance** > **Preferences** > **Video meetings**. When enabled, a Teams link is automatically added whenever you create a video meeting in SuperOffice CRM. By default, this option is set to **on**, so you don't need to change anything. If you prefer not to have a direct link, you can update this setting in video meetings.

Here's how the video link looks in a follow-up:

If you're not already using video meeting links in SuperOffice CRM, there's no better time to [set it up][1] – it will make your workday much smoother.
