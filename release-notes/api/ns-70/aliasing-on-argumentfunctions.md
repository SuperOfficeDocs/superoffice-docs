# Aliasing on ArgumentFunctions

You can now set an alias name on an ArgumentFunction Such as Day, Count, …

* Earlier, you could say Count(fieldInfo) with an alias on the fieldInfo.

* Now you can set the alias on the function itself, making it possible to use the same fieldInfo in multiple functions – such as dateparts

You can then retrieve values by alias name, instead of ordinal number
