# Real dates

We changed our datetime format from seconds-since-1970 to a real datetime.

So now we can search for dateparts, all the databases support it.

> [!NOTE]
> Using an `ArgumentFunction` means that the return field no longer has a name (itâ€™s enclosed by the function). Therefore we use the `Alias.Name` to give it a name that we can then use when calling `Reader.GetInt32()`. You could always use a position index instead, but that makes the code much more fragile in the face of changes.

See the QueryExecutionHelper class for more help.
