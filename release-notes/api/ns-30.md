# NetServer 3.0 (November 2007)

Quite a few breaking changes in this release. It included all the improvements needed to support SuperOffice web.

## Static construction functions

Entities have gained static constructors to hide the inner classes.

**The old style:**

Used nested classes that you had to create and cast either implicitly or explicitly to get an entity.

```csharp
Contact c = new Contact.IdxContactId( 123 );
```

**The new style:**

Uses a static function to give a similar but easier API. The inner class is hidden from view:

```csharp
Contact c = Contact.GetFromIdxContactId( 123 );
```

## Reading properties is safe

The sentry will not throw a security exception when you attempt to read a hidden property. Instead, the sentry will return a blank value instead of the actual value.

> [!NOTE]
> Attempting to change a read-only value will trigger a sentry exception. Use the Sentries property to find out the field-rights for the property you are interested in tweaking.

## Userdefined fields

The rows objects no longer have Udef helpers - these have moved up into the Entities layer.

## Assembly changes

The number of assemblies used got reduced drastically.

The following are combined into *SoCore.dll*:

* SuperOffice.Factory.dll
* SuperOffice.Exceptions.dll
* SuperOffice.Customization.dll
* SuperOffice.Configuration.dll

SOCORE does not require a database connection and can be deployed on clients using web services.

The following are combined into *SoDatabase.dll*:

* SuperOffice.HDB.dll
* SuperOffice.RDB.dll
* SuperOffice.Data.dll
* SuperOffice.Security.dll

This DLL requires a connection to the database set up in the app config file.

If you are not using the database directly, you need to look at the web services documentation.

## Namespace changes

Quite a few namespaces got renamed and combined.

SuperOffice client-specific things go into the `SUPEROFFICE.CRM` namespace. All CRM specific code should be in this namespace. This includes information stored in the SuperOffice CRM database and information currently held in these namespaces.

| NetServer 2.x | NetServer 3.x | Description |
|---|---|---|
| SuperOffice.Data.Administration | SuperOffice.CRM.Administration | User interface independent (user-) administration functions |
| SuperOffice.Data.Documents | SuperOffice.CRM.Documents | Document handling (Template variables are held in objects under SuperOffice.CRM.Globalization) |
| SuperOffice.Data.Meta | SuperOffice.CRM.Data | Information about tables and fields in the CRM database |
| SuperOffice.Data.Sentry | SuperOffice.CRM.Security | Calculates who can access what data |
| SuperOffice.Globalization | SuperOffice.CRM.Globalization | Language and resource dependent stuff like phone, name and address formatting. Template variables and tags. |
| SuperOffice.HDB | SuperOffice.CRM.Rows | Rows is easier to understand. |
| SuperOffice.HDB.Sentry | - | Removed - not needed |
| SuperOffice.HDB.MDO | SuperOffice.CRM.Lists | |
| SuperOffice.RDB | SuperOffice.CRM.Entities | Entity aggregates row objects into business objects. |
| SuperOffice.RDB | SuperOffice.CRM.Archives | Archives are multi-column lists. These are hard-coded lists. They are superceded by the new ArchiveList namespaces, which are dynamic and flexible. |
| SuperOffice.Services | SuperOffice.CRM.Services | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Carriers | SuperOffice.CRM.Services | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Factories | SuperOffice.CRM.Services | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Reflecteion | SuperOffice.CRM.Services.Reflection | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Sentry | SuperOffice.CRM.Services.Security | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Switches | SuperOffice.CRM.Services.Switches | |
| SuperOffice.Services.SOAP | SuperOffice.CRM.Services.SOAP | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Util | SuperOffice.CRM.Services.Util | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Implementation. | SuperOffice.CRM.Services.Implementation. | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Proxy. | SuperOffice.CRM.Services.Proxy. | |
| SuperOffice.Services.Stub. | SuperOffice.CRM.Web.Services. | |
| | SuperOffice.CRM.Data.Util | **new** - helper classes for the database classes. |
| | SuperOffice.Util | **new** - helper classes and enums for everyone. Converters, template base classes, etc. |

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the old namespaces, like `SuperOffice.Data`, will not disappear completely, despite the renaming sketched above.

`SuperOffice.Data` will contain the general query classes, the dialect base classes, and so on.

### Agents (web services)

Several new agents have been introduced, adding more sophisticated services to the NetServer services API:

* Searching
* Archive lists
* MDO Lists

## Carriers (web services)

The entity carriers have been expanded with several new fields:

* table and field rights
* foreign-key and extra info
* the basic entity data

This makes it possible for a client to check the sentry security on an entity without having direct access to the database.

## SOAP (web services)

These changes do not affect you if you are using the SuperOffice WebService DLLs, which automatically include the new namespace and serialization.

However, you cannot mix different versions of the DLLs: you cannot use a version 3 DLL to call a version 2 web service.

### SOAP Namespace

The namespace for the SOAP elements has changed. You will need to regenerate any web-reference proxies. The XML namespace changed 24.april.2007. NetServer Beta 1 and CTP clients are not compatible with the latest version.

### SOAP Serialization

The serialization format for the SOAP messages has changed, so you will need to regenerate any web-reference proxies you have. The XML inside the SOAP messages is quite different as of 24.april.2007.
