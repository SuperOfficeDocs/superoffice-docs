# SuperOffice Service 9.1 R01 update

## GUI - Clean new look and feel

In general, the color palette is softer and gentler – to reflect a more mindful and sustainable approach to business and growth.

All shadows and background patterns have been replaced with clean sharp edges – for more accessible viewing and reading and to help you stay focused on the actual data.
