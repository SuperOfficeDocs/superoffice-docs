# SuperOffice Standard CRM 9.1 R01 update

## GUI - Clean new look and feel

In general, the color palette is softer and gentler – to reflect a more mindful and sustainable approach to business and growth.

All shadows and background patterns have been replaced with clean sharp edges – for more accessible viewing and reading and to help you stay focused on the actual data.

## Improved micro-interactions for clearer navigation

If you take a look, you will see that SuperOffice CRM now has more visible and more intuitive micro-interactions throughout the interface.

This means that when your mouse hovers over a particular part of the screen, this **area is highlighted** and **tooltips** (where you can navigate to) are presented with one click – so you always know exactly where you are and what you can do from there.

## Flexibility to optimize your screen space

You can now change the size of any of the three main panels and give priority to the data that you want to be more visible or to better accommodate the particular task you are working on. For example, if you are working with a long list, you can minimize the top or side panels, so your visibility of the list becomes better and easier to work with.

You can now also collapse the side and navigation panels. This way you’ll shut out unwanted noise and give yourself more space to work with.

## Filter and group for fast sorting and organizing

The archives panel at the bottom of your screen in SuperOffice CRM – where you get an overview of all the information connected to a company, contact, sale, project, or selection – is now much more configurable.

New filtering and grouping options make it easy to pull out and see the data you need quickly and efficiently.

You can apply the filter function to any of the columns and then select exactly which information you want to filter on.

## CRM – Configure your columns

You can now drag and drop every tab and column in the archives panel of your SuperOffice CRM – letting you arrange them exactly the way you want it.

Put the tabs or columns that are more important to you in more visible positions and move away the ones that are not.

With a few mouse clicks, you can now set up the view that makes the most sense to you and your business.

## A more functional side panel that boosts your efficiency  (9.1 R01)

The new panel replaces the old mini card and stretches the full length of the screen, instead of just half. With the extra space, it will be a lot easier to view key data and previews, as well as to simultaneously carry out various tasks.

You can also drag the panel horizontally to use as much of the screen as you need, or collapse it to make it disappear completely – giving you more control over what and how you view your CRM information.

## More informative and actionable options

You can get an instant preview of any data line that is highlighted in your archives panel.

So, for example, if you are working through a list of activities, such as phone calls or meetings in a Sale or Project screen, you can highlight any of them and see the details and description notes you’ve made in the appointment without clicking out of your list.
