# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.1.5 update

## Scripts – Support of scripts in Mobile CRM

Mobile CRM adds support for executing additional [CRMScript event triggers][1]. The event scripts need to be defined in the Service web client.

Mobile already supported triggers in these categories:

* Service: new request
* Service: request changed

This release adds additional triggers from these categories:

* CRM: before save
* CRM: after save

All entities are supported, except those you can't create or edit in Mobile:

* Stakeholder
* Quote
* Relation
* Selection
* Selection member

> [!NOTE]
> One feature from CRMScript triggers that is currently not supported in Mobile is **NavigateTo** (neither custom or soprotocol navigation).
