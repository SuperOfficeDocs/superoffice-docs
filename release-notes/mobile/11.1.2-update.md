# Mobile CRM 11.1.2 update

## Follow-up - Create video meeting link

Using Mobile CRM on the go is important for many SuperOffice users. When creating a meeting, you can also add a video meeting link (if your system is set up for [video meetings][1]). An invite is then sent to all participants with the relevant details.

To do this, simply create a new follow-up, add your participants, and click the Meeting URL field to generate a video meeting link.

## Project - Display links

When working on projects across multiple teams or systems, you often need to bring information together from different sources. The Links tab makes this easy by letting you connect activities, sales, projects, documents, or websites directly to your project.

To access everything you need on the go, just open Mobile CRM, find the project and view all the connected links in one place.
