# Mobile CRM 10.2.18 update

## Follow-up - Add email addresses as attendees

Working with follow-ups and invitations you may encounter issues when attendees are not in your SuperOffice CRM contacts.

Now, you can add an email address as an attendee from the **Task** menu in the **Participant** screen. This allows you to send invitations immediately, even if the person is not a contact yet. You can consider adding them as a contact later.
