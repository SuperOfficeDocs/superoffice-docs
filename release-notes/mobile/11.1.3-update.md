# Mobile CRM 11.1.3 update

## Scan business card from the create menu

We uses AI to analyze the business card and achieved an almost 100% accuracy. Because of this you will not need to swap fields and values, like moving a post code number from the phone number field into the post code field.

You can also initiate the business card scanner from the Project screen and by that automatically link the Contact to a Project.
