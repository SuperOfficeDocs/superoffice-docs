# Mobile CRM 11.0.3 update

## Time & Date picker - time wheel and calendar

How can you select date and time in Mobile CRM? With the **time wheel** and **calendar** selector, it's easy peasy to choose the correct time and date for your content, either it's your new follow-up or a sale date.

With the time wheel is easy to first select the hour and then the minutes, and to select the date, simply select the correct date in the calendar. No hassle with the long scroll to select correct time and date.

Only for mobile phones with **Android** OS, iOS has had this functionality for some time.
