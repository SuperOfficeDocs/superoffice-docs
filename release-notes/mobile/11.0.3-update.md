# Mobile CRM 11.0.3 update

## Time and date picker - time wheel and calendar

Available for mobile devices running **Android OS**.

Need to select a date and time in Mobile CRM? With the **time wheel** and **calendar** selector, it's easy to choose the precise time and date for any entry, whether it's setting a follow-up or planning a sale.

The time wheel lets you pick the hour first, followed by the minutes, so there's no endless scrolling to get it right. For date selection, simply tap on the correct date in the calendar – it's fast, intuitive, and hassle-free.
