# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.0.1 update

## SuperOffice has launched a new CRM app

We have released a new mobile CRM app: **SuperOffice Mobile CRM**. You can recognize the new Mobile CRM app from the green SuperOffice logo.

The new app has the new look and feel as the SuperOffice CRM version 9. It is also significantly faster to use. All new features will be added to the Mobile CRM application under the G9 roadmap.

All users of **SuperOffice 9** are advised to download and use the new mobile CRM app instead of the Pocket CRM app. If you use SuperOffice 9, you can continue to use Pocket CRM, however, we will not develop any new features for the Pocket CRM app.

Users who use SuperOffice version **8.5 or lower** can continue to use Pocket CRM as they are used to.

Our previous CRM app, Pocket CRM, will still be available and show data from your SuperOffice database when you use SuperOffice 9. However, we will not develop new features for Pocket CRM.

## How to upgrade

To be able to use the new app you need:

* SuperOffice CRM version 9.1 or newer
* Android OS: version 5.0 or newer
* iOS: version 10.0 or newer (iPhone 5S or newer)

To migrate to the new app, download the new (green owl) and delete Pocket CRM (red owl) from your device.

You can download **SuperOffice Mobile CRM** from the App Store or Google Play.
