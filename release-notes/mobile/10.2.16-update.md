# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.2.16 update

## Request type on Requests

To support the possibility to target a set of attributes needed for a specific process, we are introducing the concept of Request types in SuperOffice Service.

The possibility to configure Request types is only available to customers with a Service Premium plan.

Mobile CRM will support changing of Request Type on the Request and adhere to available Status and Priority values and default values, but not filter on which fields to show or hide.

The possibility to configure Request types is only available to customers with a Service Premium plan.
