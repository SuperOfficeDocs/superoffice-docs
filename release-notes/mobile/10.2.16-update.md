# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.2.16 update

## Request types

All requests that are registered in SuperOffice have a [request type][2]. The default type is "Request". A specific request type targets a set of attributes needed for a specific process. The main benefit of request types is efficient support.

Mobile CRM supports changing a request's type and adheres to available status-, priority-, and default values. You cannot filter which fields to show or hide.

The possibility to configure Request types is available only to customers with a Service Premium plan.
