# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.2.11 update

## Request with sale and project fields

When you are in a sales process or working with a project it's neat to link this to incoming requests. Add wanted project and sale to the request, and you find the request under the request tab on the sales or project screen.

Read more about [requests][1] in the Learn section.

![Request tab on the sale screen shows linked requests -app-screen][img1]
