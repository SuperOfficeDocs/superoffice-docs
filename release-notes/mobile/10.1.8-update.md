# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.1.8 update

## Mobile CRM – Diary with drag-and-drop

With the drag-and-drop function in Diary, you can be pretty efficient to reorganize and move around your follow-ups like appointments and phone calls.

1. Click on the wanted appointment. It shows the appointment over the whole diary.
2. Push down and then drag it to the new time you want the appointment.
3. Release your finger when you are happy and the appointment is moved.

You can of course also drag and drop inside the diary to create new follow-ups.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is not new. However, earlier, scrolling up and down caused appointments to be moved unintentionally; now, the pause prevents this.

## Languages – 5 new UI languages on all modules
