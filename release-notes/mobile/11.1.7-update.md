# Mobile CRM 11.1.7 update

## All day events in Diary

When using the Diary on a small screen, it can be easy to miss important information if you have many follow‑ups. To help with this, all **all‑day events** are grouped together at the top of your Diary, where you can choose to show or hide them as needed.

If you have more than two all‑day events, a link appears below the section showing **+x more events**, where x indicates the number of hidden events. Click this link to display all all‑day events. Once they are visible, you can select **Hide events** to collapse the section again and see more of your Diary.

## Sections for Contacts - Show person type icon

Screens such as **Company**, **Projects**, and **Sales** include a section for linked **contacts**. Selecting this section opens an overview of all related contacts.

In the **contact sections** on the Company, Sales, and Projects screens, each contact in the list is displayed with an icon indicating their **person type**:

* Green for yourself
* Blue for a colleague
* Grey for an external contact

These icons make it easier to **quickly identify** which contacts are internal team members and which are external collaborators.
