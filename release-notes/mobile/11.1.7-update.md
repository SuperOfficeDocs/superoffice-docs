# Mobile CRM 11.1.7 update

## All day events in Diary

Support for many "All day" events by adding the possibility to "Show more" so you get the whole list.

When there are more than two such "All day" events, a link-button will be displayed indicating that there are more all day appointments for this day.

## Project members and Sales stakeholder - Show person type icon

In the Company and Projects screens, person lists include an icon that shows whether a person is a colleague (blue) or an external contact (grey). This makes it easier to quickly identify which project members are internal team members and which are external collaborators.
