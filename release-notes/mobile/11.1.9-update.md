# Mobile CRM 11.1.9 update

## Automatic lead category update on sale completion

Managing leads often requires quick updates across multiple places. With [Lead management][1], category updates for companies and contacts are now handled more automatically.

When a sale linked to a lead is marked as Sold, the category is automatically updated to the configured target category. You can also choose to prompt the user with a confirmation question before updating the company or contact category.

Working with lead needs quick changes and remember to update all places. With [Lead management][1] you have a more automatic solution of categories on companies and contacts.

When a sale connected to a lead is set to sold, the category are automatic updated to wanted category. Your solution can also trigger a question if it is correct to update the category of this company/contact.

## Company - Country and Stop indicator

To work more efficiently with companies, it’s important to understand key information at a glance. The company list now displays:

* The company’s country (as a flag)
* The Stop indicator, if the company is marked with Stop

This makes it easier to identify important restrictions or context directly from the list view.
