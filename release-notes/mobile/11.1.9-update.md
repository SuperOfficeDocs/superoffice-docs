# Mobile CRM 11.1.9 update

## Lead categorisation - Automatic update of category on sale sold or lost

Managing leads often requires quick updates across multiple places. With [Lead management][1], category updates for companies and contacts are now handled more automatically, where you set up different rules when sale is sold, lost or registered.

When a sale linked to a lead is marked as Sold, the category is automatically updated to the configured target category. You can also choose to prompt the user with a confirmation before updating the company or contact category.

## Company - Country and Stop indicator

To work more efficiently with companies, it’s important to understand key information at a glance. The company list now displays:

* The company’s country (as a flag)
* The Stop indicator, if the company is marked with Stop

This makes it easier to identify important restrictions or context directly from the list view.
