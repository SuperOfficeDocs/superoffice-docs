# Mobile CRM 10.2.18 update

## Appointment - Add only an e-mail address as participant

Working with appointments and invitations might give you sometime a headache when some of the participants is not added as contacts in your SuperOffice CRM.

With the option under **Task** in the **Participant** screen, you can add an e-mail address as a participant and send out the invitation without any delay.

You might want to consider to add this person as a contact later on, but this is a good solution to invite persons that is not currently added into your solution.
