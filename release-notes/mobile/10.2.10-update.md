# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.2.10 update

## Filter icon on Task button for lists

When you view different lists, you can set a filter on what you want to see in the list. Going to a different contact or company or view, that the filter is still set will sometime give an empty list or a view not containing what you are looking for. Having the visual knowledge that a filter is on, it's easier to remember to change the filtering or remove it and continue to view all items in the list.
