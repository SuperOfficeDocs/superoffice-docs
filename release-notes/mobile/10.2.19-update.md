# Mobile CRM 10.2.19 update

## Follow-up - Description split into Title, Agenda, and Internal notes

With the changes to the Follow-up dialog in SuperOffice, the same changes are seen in the Mobile CRM app.

The description field is now divided into three distinct fields: Title, Agenda, and Internal notes.

You can also add a participant by entering [only their email address][1]. This is handy if the attendee is not already added as a person in SuperOffice.

## Follow-up - View all links between different content

When working with follow-ups, you may need to link to other content such as documents, other follow-ups, sales, projects, and URLs. All these links are now visible in the **Links** section. Simply select the button to view all linked items.

Please note, links can only be added from SuperOffice CRM, not from the Mobile CRM app.
