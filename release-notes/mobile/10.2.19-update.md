# Mobile CRM 10.2.19 update

## Follow-up - Description split to Title, Agenda and Internal notes

With the changes on the Follow-up dialog in SuperOffice CRM module, the same changes are seen in Mobile CRM as well.

The most visual change is that the description field is split into three different fields: Title, Agenda and Internal notes.

## Follow-up - View of all links between different content

Working with follow-ups sometimes gives a need to link to other content, like document, other follow-ups, sales, projects and url's. All this links are visible in the **Links** section, just click them and get the Links overview to see more of the linked items.

It's only possible to add links from SuperOffice CRM module, not from Mobile CRM module.
