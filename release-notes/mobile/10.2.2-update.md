## Notifications – Notifications for Sale Quote approval

In Mobile CRM you will now be notified if someone needs **approval** for their sale quote to be sent to customer. You can see all the important details about the sale in Mobile CRM and **Approve** or **Deny** the sale quote. The person who issued the approval will get notified immediately. This makes the quote approval flow easy and without any friction. The sale must go on.
