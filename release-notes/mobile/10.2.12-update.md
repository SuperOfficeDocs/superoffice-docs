# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.2.12 update

## Drill down on Dashboard

Working with **dashboard** sometimes gives you some numbers you are more curious about.

With the **drill down** option on dashboard, you have the option to select the wanted section, see the **details** behind the section, and then even go further down to see the actual item in the section.

Tile entities **not** supporting drill down in Mobile CRM:

* Product
* Chat conversation
* Form submissions
* Mailings
