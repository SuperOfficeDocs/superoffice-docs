# SuperOffice Mobile CRM - 10.0.3 update

## Mobile CRM – new header in the Appointment screen

We have implemented a new and improved header to clearly show the date and time.

**Action** buttons have also been added for faster access to the most used functionality.

## Mobile CRM – improved user experience for action buttons

When you click on any **Action** button that takes you to another application, (for example Maps, email) or starts a call or SMS, you will now go through an additional step.

Before the action is carried out you will be able to see the address, email, phone number, and such that the **Action** button will use. You can then decide whether to continue with the action.
