# Mobile CRM 11.1.5 update

## New company - With company completion

Adding new companies can often be time-consuming and error-prone. **Duplicate entries, misspellings, and incomplete details** are common challenges when information is entered manually.

With the **Company completion** functionality, you get smart suggestions that help you avoid these issues. You'll see both **existing companies** already stored in SuperOffice and **suggested company** details from external sources. This allows you to quickly verify the information and add the correct company with just **one click** - a fast and efficient way to keep your data clean and accurate.

Scroll through the list to review the suggestions:

* Companies already in SuperOffice are shown with a company icon first in the list.
* New companies are shown without an icon last in the list, and you can expand the drop-down to view more details.

If none of the suggestions are relevant, you can select **Skip** and add the company details manually.

> [!TIP]
> Change the **country** to get more accurate data, so the AI search engine knows where to start gathering information.

## Company and Contact - Lead status

To support a structured **lead qualification** process, sales teams need to distinguish between new, in-progress, and disqualified leads.

When setting up your [lead categories][1], each category includes a **Lead status** field. This lets you define exactly where a lead is in its journey and fine-tune how leads are managed and followed up throughout the sales process.

## Follow-up - Complete follow-up by long press

Your Diary often contains follow-ups that need quick action - whether that's completing, deleting, or reviewing them.

To work more efficiently, simply **long-press** a follow-up to open a menu with key actions:

* View follow-up
* Complete (toggle)
* Delete follow-up

This makes it easy to manage your follow-ups directly from the **Diary** and stay on top of your daily tasks.
