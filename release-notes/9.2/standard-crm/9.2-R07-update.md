# SuperOffice standard CRM 9.2 R07 update

## Activities archive with new type select

The different **activity types** are listed in a drop-down menu. Check or uncheck the ones you want to see.

The menu takes up less room and it's easy the activity types selected.

## Optimized navigator search on contact

You can search for multiple words in the **navigator search** in contact.

To make the search better and faster, there is a limit of three search words.

You can still search for both contact name and company name, but you are limited to 3 words in total.

## Customer language with multiple checks

A new contact will receive an **email** to notify them that their details have been saved. But what **language** should the email be sent in?

These checks will also be used when sending out **invitation emails,** to make sure contacts get the best language support.

SuperOffice CRM comes with 12 or 16 translated email templates by default. (The GDPR templates come in 12 different languages.)

We have expanded the language check to contain the following parameters:

1. If a preferred contact language is set and an email template is available in this language, this will be used.

2. Otherwise, if the contact's country can be mapped to a corresponding email template, this will be used.

3. If none of the previous give a hit, the preferred document language for the logged-in user is checked, and if an email template with this language is found, this will be used.

4. If preferred doc language preference is not set, the UI language the user has selected for SuperOffice CRM will be checked, and if a corresponding email template is found, this will be used.

5. If none of the above give any hits, the English email template will be used.

## Archives with column clean-up

There has been a clean-up of selectable columns in the different **archives**.

Some of the **column** options from before served no purpose. For example, appointment fields in the **Contacts** archive. Since a contact is linked to several appointments, the column would not give any valuable data in return.

It is now less cluttered and easier to find **columns** to show in each **archive**.
