## Export to Excel from archives

The **Export to Excel** function is a batch task that gives you the possibility to continue work as normal while the export takes place. This is good, especially when working on large exports that can take a while.

When the batch task is finished, the **Save as** dialog will appear, and you can save it in the desired folder.

## Sales criteria on Sale Stakeholder
