The info also includes the status of the mailing and whether the recipient has received and read the mailing.

The preview is created using real-time information, which may have changed since the mailing was sent.

## Contact side panel with projects

On the **preview of contact** you will see all the **projects** this contact is a member of.

Itâ€™s also easy to navigate to the different projects from here, by clicking on the project links.
