## Chat – Transfer by managers

You, as an agent, can transfer a chat to another agent.

A manager can also take over the chat or transfer this to another agent. With this possibility, you have some administrator rights to make sure the customer gets an agent that is available and can help the customer correctly.

## Chat – Add lunch in the opening hours

Setting up a chat channel, it’s very valuable to add the opening hours if your company does not have 24/7 opening hours.

If you also have set lunch hours, you can also add the time. With this option set, your customers get info about why they won’t get instant reply/help on the chat at that exact time.
