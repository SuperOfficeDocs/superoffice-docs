# SuperOffice Service 9.2 R06 update

## Events – export of triggers in packets

When customizing an installation, you sometimes want to **export** the different changes to **package**. You can also export (and import) **screen choosers and triggers** and reuse them in other installations.

This will help when setting up a test environment, with the same **triggers** as the production installation.
