## Customer Engagement Platform

Customer Center redefined as part of the Customer Engagement Platform.

The ability to publish a **Customer Center**, manage external users, and provide a website for self-service to customers is from now on re-packaged as part of the **Customer Engagement Platform** concept.

Existing customers with access to the Customer Center today will automatically get a subscription to the Customer Engagement Platform at no extra costs, and effectively experience no change. They will, however, gain the benefit from all future development and features added to this concept.

## Chat widget fixes for 3rd party cookies

When the chat widget is placed on an external page, the browser detects a third-party cookie. This results in the widget sometimes being blocked.

Introducing the possibility to open the chat widget in a new window, allows you to write and get comments in the same session without being blocked or missing information.
