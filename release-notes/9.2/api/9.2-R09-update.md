# SuperOffice APIs 9.2 R09 update

## NetServer Logger requirements

NetServer has switched from using a baked-into-the-code logger to using an extensible plugin system of **ILogger** based loggers.

The old logger now lives in *SuperOffice.Logging.dll*, but you can remove it, replace it, or add more loggers alongside it.

All the logger plugins are used - there is no preferential treatment among the `ILoggers`.

* For web applications, ASP.NET will load all the DLLs in the bin folder automatically.
* For console applications, you will need to add the plugins to the `<DynamicLoad>` section or add explicit references to make sure the DLLs are loaded and found by the class factory.

For more information, see the [NetServer documentation][1].
