# SuperOffice Marketing 9.2 R09 update

## Mailing – Tracked links with new hostname

Generated tracked links contain a hashed string, which includes hostname. There are scenarios where it may be necessary to change the hostname but this will render links invalid. It’s possible to add the new hostname into the database.

> [!NOTE]
> Adding a new hostname can only by a consultant or the Online team in SuperOffice.

This will make sure that mailings with links sent to customers earlier, also work after the new hostname is enabled (this requires more setup to handle the redirect from the old URL to the new on web servers).
