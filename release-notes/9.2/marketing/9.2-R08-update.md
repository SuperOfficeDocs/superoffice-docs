On each field on the form there is a setting, **Full width**, where you set yes or no to show the field in one column or both columns.

When the screen is small (like on mobile or other), the rank is as the fields are placed in the overview (left to right).

## Forms – The request view of a form

The **form response** will be added to the created **request**, and have a table structure format, to make it easier to read the content. If there are multiple selections, those will be displayed as bullet points.

## Forms – Create requests with forms

On your customer portal, it’s useful to give your customers an opportunity to send in requests.

By creating a form using the fields:

* Request – Title
* Request – Category
* Request – Message

you get some extra fields in the **Actions** tab, where you select the **Default category** and the **priority**.

There is also a setting for **Include form fields** (Yes/No) – by selecting Yes, you get the form submission info in a table inside the request.

This is a neat way to create requests directly in Service with a form, and all info is included as request info.
