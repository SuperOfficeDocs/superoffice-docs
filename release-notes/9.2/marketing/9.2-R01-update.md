# SuperOffice Marketing 9.2 R01 update

## Forms available as a separate add-on

The ability to create new **Forms** has until now only been available for Marketing and Complete users.

With SuperOffice CRM 9.2, Forms is available as a company-wide add-on subscription.

For existing customers with access to **Forms**, the only change is that all users except Standard user plans now have access to create and edit Forms.

## Improved bounce management

The ability to handle **bounced emails** and spam complaints has been improved.

Emails that are failing for permanent reasons or have bounced several times will be **automatically blocked and skipped** in future mailings. All blocked email addresses will be archived in one place. This will allow for a better overview and easier clean-up of failing email addresses.

From the archive, you can open a contact card to manually correct the email address, or you can delete all failing email addresses. Online Mailgun customers will also be able to see if recipients are reporting an email as spam or junk in a **separate Spam complaints** archive. Spam complaints normally indicate that the recipient has not approved receiving this type of email from you.

Finally, SuperOffice is trying to prevent misspelled emails in the system as an effective way to prevent bouncing emails. This is done by validating incoming email addresses through Chat and Forms. We perform a DNS lookup and validation of basic email syntax.
