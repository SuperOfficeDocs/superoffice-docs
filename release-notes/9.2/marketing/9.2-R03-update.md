## Forms – pre-filled check box options

When you publish a form, you might want to pre-fill a check box, so the user of the form does not need to check it.

To do so:

1. Select **Show with pre-filled fields**.
2. Edit the URL: add the wanted checkbox text with ["xxx"] after the field name. (xxx = text of the checkbox)
3. Use that edited URL for the form. For example:

    `…&field_Choose%20Date%3A=["September%2010th%2009:00-11:00%20CET"]&…`
