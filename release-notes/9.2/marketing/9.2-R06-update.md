## Forms – Watermark with Powered by SuperOffice

On a form, there is a **Powered by SuperOffice** watermark in the top right corner. This is information that the form has been created by and used with SuperOffice CRM.

## Forms – Specify default category and business

When creating a new contact and/or company based on the form fields, you can set up the **default category and business** on the tab for **Actions**.

With this option, you can group the form submissions and new contacts to one specific category and/or business. For example, if you have a form for prospects, you select prospects as your category.

You can then easily create selections based on this category and/or business.

## Forms – Added request are set with Origin = Form

When setting up a form, you can choose that a request is automatically made when the form is filled out and submitted. The request will have a default setting of **Origin** = Form as the **source.** This will make it easier to set up rules in Service for which category or list it will appear in.

Once the **source** is set, it’s easier to group the requests and also get statistics on the number of requests generated (forms filled in) for different forms.

## Forms – The form submission shows icons instead of numbers

When using the different **rating** fields, you get icons to click.

On the form submission, you will also see the **icon** with the rating, so it’s easier to understand what type of rating it is:

* Stars
* Dice
* Thumbs
* Smiley
* NPS
