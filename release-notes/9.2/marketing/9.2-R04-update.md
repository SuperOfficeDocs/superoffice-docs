The set-up in Mailings has changed to provide more accurate tracking of emails sent and is better matched to the fields used in the Google Channel reports.

When in the setup of carrying out a mailing, you have the option to use Google Analytics as the tracking system.

The set-up in Mailings has changed to provide more accurate tracking of emails sent and is a better match to the fields used in the Google Channel reports. If you already use Google Analytics to track website traffic, then you will want to recognize the different sources of traffic including emails sent from SuperOffice.

**Email** is now the pre-defined medium in automated UTM tags. This means that tracking of mailings sent from SuperOffice CRM is now found in Google Channel reports under **Emails** rather than **other**.

To identify the specific email as a source, the fields for **Source** and **Campaign** must be completed. This will provide more accurate tracking and reporting in Google.
