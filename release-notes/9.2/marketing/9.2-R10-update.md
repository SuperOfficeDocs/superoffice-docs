## Forms – Form response with request variables

Request variables are available when creating a **Form response mailing**. When using the editor, you will get **Request ID** and **Title** as per-defined choices in the **Merge Tags** drop-down. Other parser variables must be written manually.

This is very useful when you use forms to create requests and to provide an automatic response to a customer with information about the created request.

## Forms – Multiple pages on the form

There is an option when you want multiple pages on the form.

In the **View elements**, you have an option to add **Section**.

Place this section between the last element on one page and the first on the next page, you will see the Section field in the preview on the side.

There is an option to show paging on the form, together with the **Previous** and **Next** buttons. Like that the user will see how many pages there are and how far they have come.

* Go to the **Style** settings and **Progress bar color** and select the color of the progress bar.
* To remove, click on the **X** button behind the color box, so the progress bar does not show on the form.
