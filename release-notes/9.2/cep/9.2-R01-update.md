# SuperOffice Customer Engagement Platform 9.2 R01 update

## A separate add-on

With SuperOffice CRM 9.2 a new concept – **the Customer Engagement Platform** – that supports interaction with customers across multiple channels, and is fully integrated with your CRM solution, has been introduced.

It contains standardized customer-facing apps for **Chat**, **Forms**, and **Customer Center**, that can be used out of the box to fit your brand experience.

In addition, it is possible to customize beyond the standard confirmation options using the different customization tools inside Expander Services.

All customizations are automatically deployed and operated on the platform. No external websites or hosting is needed.

Existing customers who already have Customer Center will automatically receive the new product at no additional cost.
