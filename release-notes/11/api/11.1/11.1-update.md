# API changes

The v11 release includes the changes since the v10.5.5 API release. However, there are a few notable differences between this `API changes` listing compared to previous versions.

1. The `SoDatabase` assembly has been split into two assemblies, `SoDatabase` and `SoDatabase.BusinessLogic`. The `SoDatabase` assembly contains the generated data access layer code, while the `SoDatabase.BusinessLogic` assembly contains the business logic and implementation code. This change is not reflected in the release notes, as it is a structural change rather than a functional one.

2. The `Web Services` section previously only accounted for changes in SuperOffice.Services.dll. Now it includes data types from SuperOffice.Services.Implementation, which is where all service agent implementations now reside.

Here are the changes in the v11.1.447 API reference:

[Continuous Database](11.1-cdd-update.md)

[NetServer Core](11.1-core-update.md)

[NetServer Services](11.1-services-update.md)

[SuperOffice.WebApi](11.1-webapi-update.md)
