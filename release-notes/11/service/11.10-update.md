# Service 11.10 update

## Request relations - better control and overview

**Request relations** makes it easy to link, organise and manage related requests in one place. With both visual and list-based views, you get a clear and structured overview of how requests are connected.

You can create hierarchical and side‑by‑side **relationships** (Related, Parent, or Child), helping you understand dependencies, track progress and manage complex service scenarios with confidence. This provides greater control, improved visibility and a smoother way to work with interconnected requests.

> [!TIP]
> You have multiple way of **adding request relations**, both in the section tab on the request, in the Task menu and on context menues on requests.
