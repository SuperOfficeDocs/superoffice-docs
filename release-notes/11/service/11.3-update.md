# Service and Request 11.3 update

## Request - Anonymise support agent on reply on requests

Some customers work with sensitive information or for some other reasons need to hide the full name of the support agent from the customers they are supporting.

In your global preferences, you can select the **Anonymise users on reply**. When enabled, the agent's actual name and email address is removed from the email details sent to the contact.
