# Service and Request 11.3 update

## Request - Anonymise support agent on reply on requests

Some customers works with sensitive information or for some other reasons need to hide the full name of the support agent from the customer they are supporting.

In your global preferences you can select the **Anonymise users on reply**
When enabled, the agent's actual e-mail address is removed from the e-mail details sent to the contact.
