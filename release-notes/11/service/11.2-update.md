# Service 11.2 update

## Request - Reply tools in Request properties

When replying to a request, you may have access to a selection of FAQs and reply templates. These can be found in the sidebar, alongside the request properties.

By clicking the **Reply Templates and FAQs** button, you can preview the content before inserting it into your message. You’ll also find buttons for **Messages** and **Attachments**, allowing you to include previous messages from the request, as well as any related attachments.

These tools help you respond more efficient when handling a request.
