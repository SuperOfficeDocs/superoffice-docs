# Service 11.2 update

## Request - Reply tools in Request properties

When replying to a request, you may have access to a selection of FAQs and reply templates. These can be found in the sidebar, alongside the request properties.

By clicking the **Reply Templates and FAQs** button, you can preview the content before inserting it into your message. You’ll also find buttons for **Messages** and **Attachments**, allowing you to include previous messages from the request, as well as any related attachments.

These tools help you respond more efficient when handling a request.

(*Available around 26.06.2025.*)

## Request - Pin request lists to the tab bar

When working with many different request lists and individual requests, you often end up with multiple open tabs. While the **Close all tabs** functions is helpful, you may want to keep certain request lists - whether default lists or request selections - easily accessible at all times.

To do this, simply right-click on the tab and select **Pin tab**. The tab will then remain visible in the tab bar whenever you need it. To remove it, just **Unpin the tab** when you’re ready to focus on other lists.

## Request - Show all linked contacts

Working with a request gives you the option to add multiple contacts to a request. This request will then show on all the linked contacts and companies, so status and answers are available from "all corners" of SuperOffice.

To see info about the linked contacts, simple click on the +2 (the number) button to get to contact pop-out.
