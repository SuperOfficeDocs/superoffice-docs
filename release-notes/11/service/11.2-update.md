# Service 11.2 update

## Request - Reply tools in Request properties

(*Available ca 26.06.2025.*)

When replying to a request, you may have access to a selection of FAQs and reply templates. These can be found in the sidebar, alongside the request properties.

By clicking the **Reply Templates and FAQs** button, you can preview the content before inserting it into your message. You’ll also find buttons for **Messages** and **Attachments**, allowing you to include previous messages from the request, as well as any related attachments.

These tools help you respond more efficiently when handling a request.

## Request - Pin request lists to the tab bar

When working with many different request lists and individual requests, you often end up with multiple open tabs. While the **Close all tabs** functions are helpful, you may want to keep certain request lists - default or request selections - easily accessible at all times.

To do this, simply right-click on the tab and select **Pin tab**. The tab will then remain visible in the tab bar whenever you need it. To remove it, just **Unpin the tab** when you’re ready to focus on other lists.

## Request - Show all linked contacts

Working with a request gives you the option to add multiple contacts to a request. This request will then show on all the linked contacts and companies, so status and answers are available from "all corners" of SuperOffice.

To view all linked contacts, click the **+2** (or similar) indicator to open the contact pop-out.
