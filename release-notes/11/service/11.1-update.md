# Service 11.1 update

## Request - Search returns the same result as the navigator search

When creating a **new request**, you'll likely want to link it to a contact, or when replying on a request, you might want to add multiple contacts. Use the search function to get the same results as you would when using the **contact navigator**.

Only remember the company name? No problem - just search for the **company**, and you'll see **all contacts** associated with it. You can then preview the contact to view further details before making your selection.
