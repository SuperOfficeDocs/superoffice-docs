# Service 11.7 update

## Requests - Filter messages on comments or replies

Working with requests often involves a mix of customer emails, user replies, and internal comments. To keep a clear overview, you can filter the message list to show either replies or internal comments.

This makes it much easier to focus on the communication you need - whether you want to review everything sent to the customer or quickly scan internal discussions.

* **Show replies** include all messages created using Reply or Reply all.
* **Show comments** include all messages added by clicking the comment icon.
