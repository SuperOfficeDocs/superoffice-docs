## Requests - Filter messages on comments or replies

Working with requests might sometimes involve a lot of mails back and forth, and also some internal comments as well.

To get that good overview, you simply select to filter on either replies or internal comments. That way it's easier to get that overview of the feedback from your customer, or internal comments.
