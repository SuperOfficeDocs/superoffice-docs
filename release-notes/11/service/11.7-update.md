## Requests - Filter messages on comments or replies

Working with requests often involves a mix of customer e-mails, replies and internal comments. To keep a clear overview, you can filter the message list to show either **replies** or **internal comments**.

This makes it much easier to focus on the communication you need - whether you want to review everything sent to the customer or quickly scan internal discussions.
