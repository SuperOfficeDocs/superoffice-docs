# Service 11.5 update

## Request types with different icons

When you’re working with multiple request types, it can be time-consuming to keep track of them all, especially when you have a lot of requests opened. To make the differential easier, the request type icon appears in front of the request ID in the tab, helping you quickly see what type of request it is. You also see the icon in front of the **request type** list menu in the Properties sidebar.

To use this feature, remember to select icons to your **Request types** in [Settings and maintenance][1].
