# Service 11.5 update

## Request - Differentiate request types with icons

When you're working with multiple request types, it can be time-consuming to keep track of them all, especially when you have a lot of requests opened. To make the differential easier, the request type icon appears in front of the request ID in the tab, helping you quickly see what type of request it is. You also see the icon in front of the **request type** list menu in the Properties sidebar.

To use this feature, remember to [select icons for your request types][1] in Settings and maintenance.

## Reply Tools - Add icon for FAQ/Reply Template underneath editor

We have now added the icon as it used to be, back underneath the editor request message. You know will be able to use the new icon/button of reply templates and FAQ’s or click on the old method. (Lots of feedback of customers wanting the old way still there).
