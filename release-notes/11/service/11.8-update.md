# Service 11.8 update

## Time zones - Agents with multiple time zones

SuperOffice Service handles **time zones** in a way that ensures your data is always shown at the correct time, wherever you are in the world.

What this means for you:

* **Times** are displayed accurately across all time zones, so you can rely on the information in your requests and records
* A consistent experience for teams working across **multiple** time zone locations
* A clearer and more reliable overview when **collaborating internationally**

You can trust that what you see reflects exactly when things happen, without confusion or the need for manual adjustments.
