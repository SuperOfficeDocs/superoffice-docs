# Service 11.4 update

## Lists of contact - Create request from the context menu for a contact

When working with customers and contacts, you often need to act quickly. For example, if a customer raises an issue during a conversation, you can create a request straight away.

Simply right-click on the contact, choose **Create request** from the context menu, describe the issue, and save it. Your support team will then be notified and can follow up as soon as they are available.

The **Create request** option is available in the context menu on all tabs that display a list of contacts, like Sale stakeholder, Project member and Company/contact section tab on Selection.
