# Settings and maintenance  11.5 update

## Requests - Request types with different icons

To make it easier to distinguish between different request types, you can choose an icon to each one.

Choose from a set of default icons and select the one that best matches the request type. The chosen icon will then be displayed for agents, making it simple to tell request types apart at a glance.
