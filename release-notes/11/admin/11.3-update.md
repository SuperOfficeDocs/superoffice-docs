# Settings and maintenance 11.3 update

## CRMScript - Trigger for Load request and message

Working with request and CRMScript you might want to add a trigger that load the requests (and message) before you show it, to make sure you have all the information containing the request before you show it.

## Preferences - Global preference to anonymise user on reply

Anonymising a support agent’s identifying information is important when handling sensitive data. It protects both the agent and the customer by:

* Preventing accidental or malicious data breaches
* Supporting compliance with privacy regulations
* Reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud

If data is ever compromised, anonymisation ensures it cannot be traced back to a specific individual, thereby safeguarding privacy and maintaining trust.

In **Global preferences** under Settings and maintenance, you’ll find an option to **anonymise user on reply** in the section for **SuperOffice Service system settings**. When enabled, the agent's actual e-mail address is removed from the e-mail details sent to the contact.

For more details, see [Anonymise support agent on reply on requests][1] in the Service overview.
