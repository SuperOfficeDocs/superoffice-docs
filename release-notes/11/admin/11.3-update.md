# Settings and maintenance 11.3 update

## CRMScript - Trigger for Load request and message

Working with requests and CRMScript, you may want to add a trigger that runs when a request or message is loaded. This ensures all necessary information is in place before it is shown. For example:

* **Load Request:** Validate request data on load to ensure all required fields are filled in before proceeding.
* **Load Message:** Load predefined response templates based on the message content to streamline the response process.

## Preferences - Global preference to anonymise user on reply

**Anonymising a support agent's** identifying information is important when handling **sensitive data**. It protects both the agent and the customer by:

* Preventing accidental or malicious data breaches
* Supporting compliance with privacy regulations
* Reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud

If data is ever compromised, anonymisation ensures it **cannot be traced back** to a specific individual, thereby safeguarding privacy and maintaining trust.

In **Global preferences** under Settings and maintenance, you'll find an option to **anonymise user on reply** in the section for **SuperOffice Service system settings**. When enabled, the agent's actual name and email address is removed from the email details sent to the contact.
