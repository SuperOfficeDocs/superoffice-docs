# Settings and maintenance 11.3 update

## CRMScript - Trigger for Load request and message

Working with requests and CRMScript you might want to add a trigger on loading the requests and/or message before you show it, to make sure you have all the information containing the request before you show it.

* For **Load Request** it could be: Perform validation checks on the request data upon loading to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly before proceeding.
* For **Load Message** it could be: Load predefined response templates based on the content of the message to streamline the response process.

## Preferences - Global preference to anonymise user on reply

**Anonymising a support agent’s** identifying information is important when handling **sensitive data**. It protects both the agent and the customer by:

* Preventing accidental or malicious data breaches
* Supporting compliance with privacy regulations
* Reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud

If data is ever compromised, anonymisation ensures it **cannot be traced back** to a specific individual, thereby safeguarding privacy and maintaining trust.

In **Global preferences** under Settings and maintenance, you’ll find an option to **anonymise user on reply** in the section for **SuperOffice Service system settings**. When enabled, the agent's actual name and e-mail address is removed from the e-mail details sent to the contact.
