# Settings and maintenance 11.9 update

## Marketing - Add new google fonts to Form fonts

Manage the fonts available for your forms in Marketing to maintain consistent design and branding. You can add fonts from our standard collection or choose from the **Google Fonts library**. Each font can be previewed before adding, and the order can be adjusted to suit your needs. Fonts already used in existing forms will remain in place even if they are later removed from the list.

Go to **Marketing** in **Settings and maintenance**, then select the **Form fonts** tab. Click **Add** to select a font. A **preview** will show how the font appears before you add it to your collection.

Newly added fonts appear at the **bottom** of the list. You can change the **rank** of a font by **drag-and-drop** it to the wanted rank in the list.

> [!TIP]
> **Reorder** the fonts to place your company’s brand fonts at the top, making them easier for users to find.
