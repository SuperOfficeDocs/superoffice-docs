# Settings and maintenance 11.6 update

## Marketing - Conversion tracking for UTM tracking

In Settings and maintenance on the Marketing section you can enable conversion tracking for all form submissions to SuperOffice CRM.

Turn on **Enable UTM data transfer on form submissions**, and add the UTM tracking script to your website(s) and include UTM parameters to your campaign links.

Read more about this feature in [Marketing - Lead source tracking][1] under Marketing 11.6 update.

## Lists - Company Category with Category group

In the **Company - Category** list, set the appropriate **Category group** and define whether the list item should be included in **lead status** tracking.

The **default category groups** are:

* Customer
* Potential Customer
* Partner
* Lost
* Other

To enable the option **Enable lead status for this category**, the category group must be set to **Potential customer**.

## Lists - Contact - Lead status

In the **Contact - Lead status** list, add the lead status values you wish to use (for example, stages in lead nurturing). These statuses are visible and actionable in the Board view for contact selections.

Read more in [Contact selection with board view][1] under Marketing 11.6 update.

## Lists - GUI Web panel - Option for always reload content on tab navigation

Creating web panels in the UI is a great way to bring external information directly into SuperOffice CRM. You can also link the panel content to SuperOffice data by using **template variables**.

To ensure the content stays up to date, enable the option **Always reload content on tab navigation**.

## CRMScript - Trigger for "Load request message" with message creation logic

The **Load request message** trigger allows you to identify and filter events based on how a message was created, using the same actions available in the **After saving request MessageAction** trigger.

The **MessageAction** value can include:

* Reply
* Reply All
* Internal Comment
* Forward

By recognising which button was pressed, you can apply specific logic for each type of message event - for example, running a script only when the **Add comment** button is used.

This provides great control and flexibility when working with the **Load request message** trigger.

## Preferences - Set Request preferences for system, group, or user

To ensure users have the most efficient experience in SuperOffice CRM, you can configure **Request preferences** with specific settings for different user groups, the entire system, or individual users.
