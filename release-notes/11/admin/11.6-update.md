# Settings and maintenance 11.6 update

## Marketing - Conversion tracking for UTM tracking

In Settings and maintenance on the Marketing section you can enable conversion tracking for all form submissions to SuperOffice CRM. You slide on the setting for Enable UTM data transfer on form submissions, and add the UTM tracking script to your website(s) and/or UTM parameters to your campaign links.

Read more about why in [Marketing Lead source tracking][1] under Marketing 11.6 update.

## Lists - Company Category with Category group and Contact Lead status

In the list for **Company - Category** you should set the Category group, and if the list item is part of the lead status. The **default category groups** are:

* Customer
* Potential Customer
* Partner
* Lost
* Other

To be able to check on the **Enable lead status for this category** field, the category group needs to be set to **Potential customer**.

In the list for **Contact - Lead status** - you add the different list items you want to use for example the Lead nurturing accessible using the board view for contact selection.

Read more in the section for [Contact selection with board view][1] in the Marketing 11.6 update.

## Lists - GUI Web panel - Option for always reload content on tab navigation

Creating web panels in the UI is a great way to bring external information directly into SuperOffice CRM. You can also link the panel content to SuperOffice data by using **template variables**.

To ensure the content stays up to date, enable the option **Always reload content on tab navigation**.

## CRMScript - Trigger for "Load request message" with message creation logic

The **Load request message** trigger allows you to identify and filter events based on how a message was created, using the same actions available in the **After saving request MessageAction** trigger.

The **MessageAction** value can include:

* Reply
* Reply All
* Internal Comment
* Forward

By recognising which button was pressed, you can apply specific logic for each type of message event - for example, running a script only when the **Add comment** button is used.

This provides great control and flexibility when working with the **Load request message** trigger.

## Preferences - Set Request preferences for system, group, or user

To ensure users have the most efficient experience in SuperOffice CRM, you can configure **Request preferences** with specific settings for different user groups, the entire system, or individual users.
