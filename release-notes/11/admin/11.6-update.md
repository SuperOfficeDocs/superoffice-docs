# Settings and maintenance 11.6 update

## Lists - GUI Web panel - Option for always reload content on tab navigation

Creating web panels in the UI is a great way to bring external information directly into SuperOffice CRM. You can also link the panel content to SuperOffice data by using **template variables**.

To ensure the content stays up to date, enable the option **Always reload content on tab navigation**.

## CRMScript - Trigger for "Load request message" with message creation logic

The **Load request message** trigger allows you to identify and filter events based on how a message was created, using the same actions available in the **After saving request MessageAction** trigger.

The **MessageAction** value can include:

* Reply
* Reply All
* Internal Comment
* Forward

By recognising which button was pressed, you can apply specific logic for each type of message event - for example, running a script only when the **Add comment** button is used.

This provides great control and flexibility when working with the **Load request message** trigger.

## Preferences - Set Request preferences for system, group, or user

To ensure users have the most efficient experience in SuperOffice CRM, you can configure **Request preferences** with specific settings for different user groups, the entire system, or individual users.
