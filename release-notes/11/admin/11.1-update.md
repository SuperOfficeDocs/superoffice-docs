# Settings and maintenance 11.1 update

## System design - Setting a field as read-only

To tailor your SuperOffice CRM solution to your needs, you may need to create several custom fields to store customer-related data. You might also want to integrate SuperOffice CRM with other key systems used within your organisation, such as an ERP system.

To ensure seamless **synchroniation** between systems and to prevent duplicate records, it's important to have unique customer numbers in both. This **unique identifier** should be visible and searchable for users, but not editable.

To achieve this, simply enable the **Show as read-only** option when creating the field. Once this setting is applied, the field will be visible but protected from user edits — and you're ready to go.
