# Settings and maintenance 11.8 update

## Workflow - Lead category automation

Automating company and contact categories helps reduce manual work and ensures your data stays accurate. When the status of a sale changes, the related company or contact can automatically be updated with the correct category — so you never forget to adjust it yourself. This can run fully automatically or ask the user to confirm the change.

You can configure four types of category automation under **Settings and maintenance** → **Workflow** → **Lead categorisation**:

1. Update category when a sale is sold
1. Update category when a sale is lost
1. Update category when a sale is registered with the company
1. Update category when a lead status is set to: xx

You decide which rules should run automatically and which should prompt the user. For example, it may not be ideal to automatically update categories when a sale is sold if you work with multiple customer tiers (VIP, A, B, C) within the same company.

For lead management, however, it’s often useful to automate the move from lead to customer or lost opportunity, ensuring consistent categorisation with far less effort.

> [!NOTE]
> **Setting 4**: If the lead status is set to "qualified" and the user manually chooses another category, the user’s choice will be kept. If the rule is configured with Ask for user confirmation = true, the user will still be prompted and can choose whether to apply the suggested category update or not.

Set up the automation of company and contact category will help you to reduce manual work. It's kind of a sequence where you change the status of a sale, will then change the company or contacts category so it's correct due to the change of the sale. Like that you wont forget to change the category and either it can go completely automatic or you get a question if the category is correct for this company/contact.

It's four different category automation you can set in the section for **Workflow** in **Settings and maintenance** on the tab for **Lead categorisation**:

1. Update category when a sale is sold
1. Update category when a sale is lost
1. Update category when a sale is registered with the company
1. Update category when a lead status is set to: xx

You just need to decide if you you want to set the category automatic on all points, or just a few of them. It might not be a good idea to set the category when a sale is sold, when you have many sales to the same company and the category are split between multiple customer categories, like VIP, A, B and C.

In lead management it's a good idea to set the category automatic to move the category from a lead to a customer or a lost opportunity. This helps to be more efficient in managing leads.

> [!NOTE]
> For number 4, when lead status is set to “qualified”, and the user is manually setting the category to something else too, the users choice should be kept. If the rule number 4 is configured with “ask for user confirmation = true”, the user should still be asked for confirmation, and can select to update the category as suggested by the automation or not.
