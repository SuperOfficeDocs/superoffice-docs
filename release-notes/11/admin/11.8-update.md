# Settings and maintenance 11.8 update

## Workflow - Lead category automation

Automating company and contact categories helps **reduce manual work** and ensures your data stays accurate. When the status of a sale changes, the related company or contact can automatically be updated with the correct category - so you never forget to adjust it yourself. This can run fully automatically or ask the user to confirm the change.

You can configure four types of category automation under **Settings and maintenance** > **Workflow** > **Lead categorisation**:

* Update category when a sale is **sold**
* Update category when a sale is **lost**
* Update category when a sale is **registered** with the company
* Update category when a **lead status** is set to: xx

You decide which rules should run automatically and which should prompt the user. For example, it may not be ideal to automatically update categories when a sale is sold if you work with multiple customer tiers (VIP, A, B, C) within the same company. If the rule is configured with **Ask for user confirmation** = true, the user will be prompted and can choose whether to apply the suggested category update or select another category.

For lead management, however, it's often useful to **automate the move** from lead to customer or lost opportunity, ensuring consistent categorisation with far less effort.
