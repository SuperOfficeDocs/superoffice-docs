# Settings and maintenance 11.10 update

## Marketing - Subscription page styling

All contacts added to your SuperOffice receive a Privacy confirmation e-mail that includes a link to their subscription settings. From here, they can easily manage which mailings they want to receive from your company.

This subscription page link is also included in all mailings, allowing contacts to update their preferences at any time. The same subscription types are used when creating a mailing, ensuring consistency when selecting the mailing type you want to send.

You can customise the look and feel of the subscription page from **Marketing** in the navigator, under the **Subscription page styling** tab, where you have a **Styling** and a **Options** section. Any changes you make are shown immediately in the preview on the right-hand side.

* **Styling** section: You can add your company logo and adjust its position, set the page width and background, and style the content, buttons and subscription toggles.

* **Options** section: You can customise the text for all supported languages. Simply select the desired language and update the **Header**, **Instructions** and **Consent text** to match your tone of voice and branding. If you delete the text in any of the fields, it will automatically revert to the SuperOffice CRM default text.

> [!TIP]
> You can **remove languages** you do not use in the **Options** section. This reduces the number of languages your contacts can select and simplifies your content maintenance. If your language setup changes later, you can easily add any language you previously removed.

## Requests - Add Request relations

You can create hierarchical and side‑by‑side relationships (Related, Parent or Child), helping you understand dependencies, track progress and manage complex service scenarios with confidence. This gives you better control, improved visibility and a smoother way to work with interconnected requests.

Read more about [how to use Request relations][2] in SuperOffice Service.

There are three default relations that cannot be edited or deleted, but you can add additional request relations to support your workflow in SuperOffice Service.

![Admin Requests - Add a new request relation and add the correct settings  -screenshot][img2]

When creating a new relation, you can assign it to a specific request type and define what type of relation it is. You also need to select the related request types it applies to. In addition, you can configure several on/off options on what should happen on closing related request. Add a clear description so your users easily understand how and when to use this relation.
