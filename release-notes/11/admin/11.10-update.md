# Settings and maintenance 11.10 update

## Marketing - Subscription page styling

All contacts added to your SuperOffice receive a Privacy confirmation e-mail that includes a link to their subscription settings. From here, they can easily manage which mailings they want to receive from your company.

This subscription page link is also included in all mailings, allowing contacts to update their preferences at any time. The same subscription types are used when creating a mailing, ensuring consistency when selecting the mailing type you want to send.

*You can customise the look and feel of the subscription page from **Marketing** in the navigator, under the **Subscription page styling** tab, where you have a **Styling** and a **Options** section.
*

On the **Styling** section, you can add your company logo and adjust its position, set the page width and background, and style the content, buttons and subscription toggles. Any changes you make are shown immediately in the preview on the right-hand side.

In the **Options** section, you can customise the text for all supported languages. Simply select the desired language and update the **Header**, **Instructions** and **Consent text** to match your tone of voice and branding. If you delete the text in any of the fields, it will automatically revert to the SuperOffice CRM default text.

> [!TIP]
> You can **remove languages** you do not use in the **Options** section. This reduces the number of languages your contacts can select and simplifies your content maintenance. If your language setup changes later, you can easily add any language you previously removed.
