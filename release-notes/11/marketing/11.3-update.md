# Marketing 11.3 update

## Marketing Flow – distribute to owner step

When working with workflows that generate new companies and contacts, it’s important to **automate** how these **leads** are assigned, to ensure that they are followed up by the appropriate person or team. The **Distribute to owner** step lets you do exactly that by setting the **Our contact** field to different colleagues in your company.

Use the step **Distribute to owner** in the flow to select an evenly distribution of ownerships of the new companies and contacts to **specific users or user groups**. Each new lead will be assigned automatically, and users will receive **notifications** about their new ownerships.

> [!TIP]
> To be included in lead distribution, make sure **your availability status** is set to **Normal** in your Personal settings.

### Lead distribution

Lead distribution is the process of automatically assigning new leads to the right sales reps or teams. Using **Flow**, you can route leads fairly or by rules such as region, industry, or product interest. This ensures faster follow-up, balanced workloads, and better customer experiences.

Common use cases:

* Assign leads to reps based on industry, customer segment, or expertise.
* Distribute leads evenly across a team to balance workloads.
* Match leads with reps by language or location.
