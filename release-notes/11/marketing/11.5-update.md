# Marketing 11.5 update

## Marketing Form - Publish with a direct link

Want to share your form quickly and easily? Use the **Direct link** from the **Publish** tab. Whether you’re adding it to an e-mail campaign or linking it from a web page, the Direct link makes publishing fast and effortless.

You can even pre-populate fields, saving your recipients time and making it more likely they’ll complete the form.
