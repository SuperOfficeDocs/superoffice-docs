# Marketing 11.5 update

## Marketing Form – Pre-populate fields linked from a mailing

With **pre-populate fields**, you can select the fields from the drop-down menu, and when contact data is already known from a mailing, those fields will be filled in **automatically**. This saves your recipients time, reduces friction, and increases the likelihood they’ll complete the form.

**Submissions** are also easier to process, as responses can be linked directly to existing contacts in your SuperOffice solution, ensuring better data quality with less duplicates.
