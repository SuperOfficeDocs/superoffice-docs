# Marketing 11.5 update

## Marketing Form – Pre-populate fields from a mailing

When working with forms, it’s important to think not only about collecting submissions, but also about how they link to your existing and new contacts.

With **pre-populate fields**, you can select the fields from the drop-down menu, and when contact data is already known (for example, from a mailing), those fields will be filled in **automatically**. This saves your recipients time, reduces friction, and increases the likelihood they’ll complete the form.

It also makes handling **form submissions** easier. Since the contact’s email address is already stored in your SuperOffice solution, you can even choose to process submissions automatically when the submitter is recognised.
