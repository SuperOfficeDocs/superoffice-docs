# Marketing 11.5 update

## Marketing Form - View mode shows Direct link in Publish

Simple url builder for users linking directly to SuperOffice Forms
For some users, basic UTM capturing for specific forms might be the most important user scenario. For example they would like to link directly to a form from a mailing, or they would like to send a form link to a partner, having them to publish the same direct link.

For these user scenarios it would be useful for the user to get some assistance with building up the url, without having to navigate elsewhere to a url builder just for creating one link.

In Forms, on the Publish tab, we offer as simple url builder, enabling the user both to add template variables and utm parameters to the link.

* Field for building a url with utm parameters should only be visible if the preference enabling utm parameters is turned on, and only if the utm so_module license is till available.

* Adding data in one of the input fields should cause the link to be extended with the corresponding utm parameter and data, enabling the user to copy the current link.

* Consider if saving the latest utm parameters is necessary. There is not probably no need for saving the data, as utm parameters will typically be varied depending on which source the link should be published in. Hence being able to copy the link while working on this should be enough.
