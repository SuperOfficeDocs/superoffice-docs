# Marketing 10.3 update

## Marketing Flow - Step to distribute to owner

When working with flows that generate new companies and contacts, it’s important to **automate** how these **leads** are assigned. The **Distribute to owner** step lets you do exactly that by setting the **Our contact** field to different colleagues in your company.

Use the step **Distribute to owner** in the flow to select an evenly distribution of ownerships of the new companies and contacts to **specific users or user groups**. Each new lead will be assigned automatically, and users will receive **notifications** about their new ownerships.

> To be included in lead distribution, make sure **your availability status** is set to **Normal** in your Personal settings.
