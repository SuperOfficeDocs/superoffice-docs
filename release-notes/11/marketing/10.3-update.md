# Marketing 10.3 update

## Marketing Flow - Step to distribute to owner

When working with flows that generate new companies and contacts, it’s important to **automate** how these **leads** are assigned, to ensure that they are followed up by the appropriate person or team. The **Distribute to owner** step lets you do exactly that by setting the **Our contact** field to different colleagues in your company.

Use the step **Distribute to owner** in the flow to select an evenly distribution of ownerships of the new companies and contacts to **specific users or user groups**. Each new lead will be assigned automatically, and users will receive **notifications** about their new ownerships.

> To be included in lead distribution, make sure **your availability status** is set to **Normal** in your Personal settings.

### What is Lead distribution?

Lead distribution is the process of assigning incoming leads to the right sales representatives or teams. The goal is to ensure that each lead is followed up by the most suitable person — improving response time, conversion rates, and overall customer experience.

You can use **Flow** as your lead routing engine to automate how leads are distributed.

**Key Steps:**

* **Distribute to Owner**
  * Automatically and fairly distribute leads across a BDR or sales team.
  * Assigned reps are instantly notified, ensuring timely follow-up.

* **Split Step**
  * Combine with **Distribute to Owner** to set up custom rules based on contact properties such as region, industry, or product interest.

#### Benefits of Automating Lead Assignment

* Save time by reducing manual lead handling.
* Improve lead quality by matching leads with the most suitable rep.
* Boost performance with fair and balanced distribution.
* Ensure consistency across campaigns and channels.
* Notify reps instantly so they can act quickly.

#### Common Use Cases

Here are some examples of how lead distribution can be used:

* Assign leads to reps who specialize in specific industries (e.g., healthcare, retail) or customer segments (e.g., SMB vs. enterprise).
* Route leads to external partners or resellers based on predefined rules (e.g., region, product interest).
* Distribute leads evenly across a team to ensure balanced workloads.
* Match leads with reps based on language, location, or product expertise.
