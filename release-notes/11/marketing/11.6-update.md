# Marketing 11.6 update

## Lead source tracking

Lead source tracking helps marketers understand exactly where leads originate, which channels perform best, and how to focus time and budget for maximum impact.

### Settings and maintenance – the Marketing navigator with UTM tracking

Enable UTM tracking in Settings and Maintenance under the **Marketing** section on the **Conversion tracking** tab.

Turn on **Enable UTM data transfer on form submissions**, and add the UTM tracking script to your website or include UTM parameters in your campaign links.

### Marketing Form - Add UTM parameters to your campaign links

To identify where leads are coming from, publish your forms using URLs that include UTM parameters. Extend a direct link or extend the links taking leads to your embedded forms. Ensure the UTM tracking script is added to your website(s) to capture source data correctly for embedded forms.

Example on how the UTM tracking will be stored in your SuperOffice CRM solution. The lead status are stored on a contact under their Legal basis.

**The 5 standard UTM parameters:**

There are five standard UTM parameters which you can add to the end your campaign links:

1. **utm_source** - Identifies the traffic source, such as Google, newsletter, or social media platform.
1. **utm_medium** - Specifies the marketing medium, for example email, CPC (cost-per-click), or banner.
1. **utm_campaign** - Defines the campaign name, such as spring_sale or black_friday.
1. **utm_term** - Used for paid search to identify which keyword triggered the ad.
1. **utm_content** - Distinguishes between different links or creatives within the same ad, such as unique call-to-action buttons.

Example: https://yourcompany.com/signup?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=webinar_sept​

> [!NOTE]
> First touch source, lead creation source and company source are only tracked for new contact persons and companies that does not already exist in your SuperOffice CRM.

## Dashboard – Lead management tiles

Dashboards provide a clear overview of where leads come from, grouped by source, medium, campaign, term, or content.

Use **Lead tiles** available under Contact to visualise performance, or add them to existing dashboards.

You can further refine dashboards using **criteria** under **Contact – Lead** or **Company – Lead**, such as *First touch...* or *Lead creation...*, to analyse performance at different tiles.

## Contact selections - Use board view to get overview of leads

Create a **Contact selection** and switch to **Board view** to manage and track leads visually.

Group the view by **Lead status** and use drag-and-drop to move contacts between statuses as they progress through the qualification process.

## Company - Category list

In the company screen the Category shows the **Lead Stage** that will describe where in the buying journey a lead is. It is used to understand how close a company is to becoming a customer. Category is set at the company level, meaning it applies to the entire company, not just one contact person.

## Contact - Lead status list

You have the list **Lead Status** in the contact screen that describes what is happening in the qualification process. It is used by BDR teams or sales reps to keep track on whether a lead has been contacted or not, and the result of the call. Lead status is set at the contact person level.
