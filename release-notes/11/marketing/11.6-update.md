# Marketing 11.6 update

## Lead source tracking

With lead source tracking marketers can:

1. See exactly where each lead came from (e.g. LinkedIn ad, newsletter, Google search).
1. Get insights into which channels or campaigns brings most leads and sales opportunities.
1. Compare which marketing effort works best, so you know where to focus your time and budget.

### Settings and maintenance – the Marketing navigator with UTM tracking

To start using the **UTM tracking**, you need to enable this in Settings and maintenance on the **Marketing** section and the tab for **Conversion tracking**. You slide on the setting for **Enable UTM data transfer on form submissions**, and add the UTM tracking script to your website(s) and/or UTM parameters to your campaign links.

### Marketing Form - Use UTM tracking when publishing the form

To be able to find out where the different leads are coming from, you should add the form with different UTM parameters for the lead source tracking and use either the direct link or one of the other options. Make sure the UTM tracking script are added to your website(s).

**The 5 standard UTM parameters:**

There are five standard UTM parameters which you can add to the end your campaign links:

1. **utm_source**: Identifies the source of the traffic, such as a search engine (e.g., google), newsletters, or social media platform.
1. **utm_medium**: Specifies the medium of the traffic, like e-mail, CPC (cost-per-click), or banner.
1. **utm_campaign**: Indicates the specific campaign name, such as spring_sale or black_friday.
1.**utm_term**: Used for paid search keywords to identify the keyword that triggered the ad.
1. **utm_content**: Differentiates similar content or links within the same ad, such as different call-to-action buttons.

Example: https://yourcompany.com/signup?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=webinar_sept​

> [!NOTE]
> First touch source, lead creation source and company source are only tracked for new contact persons and companies that does not already exist in your SuperOffice CRM.

## Dashboard – Lead management tiles

To get that overview of where all your leads come from, what source, medium, campaign, term or content, you create a dashboard (or add tiles to an existing) and use the different lead tiles under Contact. Read more about the different tiles in Core Dashboard – Tiles.

As for data source, you can also use the criteria under Contact – Lead or Company – Lead for “First touch…” or “Lead creation…”, to fine-tune the different tiles you want to use.

## Contact selections - Use board view to get overview of leads

To get a good overview of lead status, don’t forget to create a contact selection, go to **board view** and select to group by **Lead status**. Now you can drag & drop the contacts to the different leads status depending on how far they have come in the lead process.

## Company Category showing Lead stage and Contact shows Lead status

The difference between **Company Lead stages** and **Contact Lead status**:

* **Lead Stage** describes where in the buying journey a lead is. It is used to understand how close a company is to becoming a customer. Category is set at the company level, meaning it applies to the entire company, not just one contact person.
* **Lead Status** describes what is happening in the qualification process. It is used by BDR teams or sales reps to keep track on whether a lead has been contacted or not, and the result of the call. Lead status is set at the contact person level.
