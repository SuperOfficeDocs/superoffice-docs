1. Get insights into which channels or campaigns brings most leads and sales opportunities.​

1. Compare which marketing effort works best, so you know where to focus your time and budget.

### 5 standard UTM parameters

There are five standard UTM parameters which you can add to the end your campaign links:

1. **utm_source**: Identifies the source of the traffic, such as a search engine (e.g., google), newsletters, or social media platform.
1. **utm_medium**: Specifies the medium of the traffic, like e-mail, CPC (cost-per-click), or banner.
1. **utm_campaign**: Indicates the specific campaign name, such as spring_sale or black_friday.
1.** utm_term**: Used for paid search keywords to identify the keyword that triggered the ad.
1. **utm_content**: Differentiates similar content or links within the same ad, such as different call-to-action buttons.

Ex.: https://yourcompany.com/signup?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=webinar_sept​

### UTM data that we track

1. First touch
  * What it means: The very first source/medium/campaign that made the person interact with our company.​
  * Where is data stored: Contact person level
2. Lead creation ​
  * What it means: The source/medium/campaign that led to the actual lead being created in the CRM.​
  * Where is data stored: Contact person level
3. Conversion ​
  * What it means: The most recent source/medium/campaign that led an existing contact to submit a new form.​
  * Where is this stored: form submission level​
4. Company source​
  * What it means: When a new contact is added and a company card is created together, the source is saved on the company card as well. ​
  * Where is it stored: company card level

> [!NOTE]
> First touch source, lead creation source and company source are only tracked for new contact persons
and companies that does not already exist in the CRM

### How to set up lead source tracking​

1. Enable UTM data transfer on form submission​
1. Add the tracking script to your website to enable UTM tracking​
* This script listens for UTM parameters in the URL and store them temporarily​
* Settings and maintenance --> Marketing & preferences​
1. Create UTM-tagged URLs​
* https://yourcompany.com/signup?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=webinar_sept​
* You can use a UTM builder or manually add parameters​
* SuperOffice UTM builder can be used for SuperOffice form page​
1. Apply the URL to all campaign sources​
* Use the tagged URL in: LinkedIn posts, email newsletters, Google ads, Facebook retargeting​

### Marketing Form - Use UTM tracking on the form submission

### Company lead stage and Contact lead status

The difference between lead stages and lead status​:

* Lead Stage describes where in the buying journey a lead is. It is used to understand how close a company is to becoming a customer. ​Category is set at the company level, meaning it applies to the entire company, not just one contact person. ​
* Lead Status describes what is happening in the qualification process. It is used by BDR teams or sales reps to keep track on whether a lead has been contacted or not, and the result of the call. ​Lead status is set at the contact person level.

### Lead status - Use the board view for contacts

Using the board view for Lead management will present lead statuses as columns in board view for contacts, making it easy to:​

* See where each lead is in the qualification process​.
* Spot bottle necks (e.g. too many leads stuck in "Contacted")​.
* Drag and drop leads between statuses to update progress in an easy way​.
* Both Marketing and Sales has visibility within the board view for leads and can see that leads are being followed up on.

## UTM / Lead source tracking

To understand which channels (e.g., Facebook, email, ads) that drives engagement and conversions, and to measure the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, our users needs more information about where the leads are coming from. Being able to attribute a new contact to the correct source will provide a clearer picture of the impact of marketing activities, and help our marketing users in making data-driven decisions.

Track lead sources using UTM parameters
You’re hosting a webinar and want to track where they signed up from. Both contacts registered for the same event (product_launch_webinar). One came from a customer email, the other from a paid ad.

Focus areas:

* Enable saving of UTM data through Global preference
* Enable UTM data support only for Marketing Premium
* Get hold of the UTM data and transfer the information to your SuperOffice upon form submission
* Ensure quality on UTM data by enforcing a few automated rules before saving the data
* Saving the “first touch UTM data” and the “lead creation UTM data” as contact source information
* Saving the last known UTM data as form submission source information
* Saving “first touch UTM data” and “lead creation UTM data” on company
* Offer UTM properties as search criteria and columns on contact and company
* Show UTM data in contact card – Edit legal basis dialog
* UTM data fields in screen designer for Contact and Company
* Admin - Marketing panel for conversion tracking
* Simple url builder for users linking directly to Forms
* correction of utm data if misspelled, or different terms have been used by mistake

## Lead management

To help our customers manage their leads more effectively, we aim to improve visibility into how leads progress through the sales funnel in SuperOffice CRM. Currently, many customers rely on company categories to indicate customer types, like prospect/customer/selling partner. We would like to make it more visible that categories can also be used for tracking lead engagement or readiness to buy.

Some focus areas:

* Group company/contact categories
* Lead statuses - To formalize the lead qualification process, a sales team should be able to differentiate between "new" and "in progress" leads, and also to disqualify those leads which are not relevant to proceed with for various reasons.
  * Enable lead status on category level
  * Extend categories with lead status information
  * Lead statuses as a customizable list in Settings and maintenance
* Lead status as search criteria
* Lead, Marketing qualified lead and Opportunity as standard categories
* Search criteria for category group
