# Marketing 11.9 update

## Form - Use Google fonts in your forms

In **Settings and maintenance** you can add **Google fonts** and manage them to make them available across all your forms. This helps ensure a **consistent design and brand identity** for users who interact with your forms externally.

Once the fonts are added and organised, the new fonts can be selected in the **Edit form** dialog, in the **Style** section of the form, as well as in the **Double opt-in**, **Thank you page**, and **Page for inactive form** sections.
