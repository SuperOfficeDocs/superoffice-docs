# Marketing 11.9 update

## Form - Use Google fonts in your forms

In **Marketing** > **Forms**, you can use the fonts that have been added in **Settings and maintenance**. Add **Google Fonts** there to make them available across all your forms. Once added, fonts can be selected in the **Styling** section, as well as in the **Double opt‑in**, **Thank you page**, and **Page for inactive form** sections.

Using Google Fonts helps ensure a **consistent design and brand identity**, allowing you to apply a single font across all content visible to external users.
