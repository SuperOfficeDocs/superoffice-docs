# What's new in SuperOffice 11

## Summary of highlights

**SuperOffice 11** - a new version of SuperOffice CRM with major improvements under the hood.

Much of the work in this release has focused on cleaning up outdated and unnecessary code, paving the way for a faster, more reliable, and future-ready solution.

At SuperOffice, relationships are at the heart of everything we do — and strong relationships begin with open, honest communication. That's why we're excited to share this new experience with you as we prepare to roll it out to our cloud customers.
