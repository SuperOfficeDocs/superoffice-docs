# Core CRM and Sales 11.2 update

## Selection - Board view for sales

More visibility, better control, and a smoother way to work.

Board view is a **visual tool** designed to give you an even clearer overview, such as for your **sales pipeline**. It has a simple, **drag & drop** layout that lets you easily move sales between stages and stay updated at a glance - whether you’re working alone or as part of a team. This means less time digging for details and more time focusing on the next right step to reach your goals.

​For sales users, using Board view in sales selections allows gaining greater control by having **all sales in view** at once, as well as improving the user experience with an intuitive drag & drop functionality to **move sales** between stages. Board view can help users increase sales by improving sales visibility, simplifying updates, and speeding up decision-making as a result of keeping a clear overview at all times.

### Filters and different settings

You can set up the board view for sales to serve your needs the best. Here are some of the settings:

* **Group by**: Select between Stage, Sale type and Owner.
* **Subgroup by**: Select the subgroup for your board to be Sale type, Project and Owner.
* **Sort by**: Amount, Sale date, Next activity.
* **Summarize by**: Amount and Weighted amount.
* **Filter toolbar**: Next activity, Owner, Owner group, Sale date, Stage, Sales type.

### Quick edit of the sale

When you work with the board view, you can see some details that are not correct and you want to edit the sale there and then.

Simply hover over the sale, see the **Edit** button or the **Task** button. Below the **Task** button you have several options, two of them are to set the sale as **sold** or **lost**.

When you click the **Edit** button, you have access to the same content of fields as on the **main card of the sale**. Change the different fields, save and the sale is updated with new information.
