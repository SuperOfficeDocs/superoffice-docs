## Selection - Board view for sales

Board view is a **visual layout for selections** that provides a pipeline-style overview. Currently available for sales, it lets you to drag and drop items between stages, quickly edit records, and track progress at a glance — whether you work individually or in a team.

It helps improve sales visibility, reduce time spent searching for information, and streamline decision-making by keeping all relevant details in view.

* **Subgroup by**: Select the subgroup for your board to be Sale type, Project and Owner.

### Edit sales directly from the board

To update a sale directly from the board, such as when you notice incorrect details, hover over the card and select either the **Edit** or **Task** button. The **Task** menu includes actions such as marking the sale as **sold** or **lost**.
