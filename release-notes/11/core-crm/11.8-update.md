# Core CRM 11.8 update

## Find - Search for Category group

When you use many different categories for customers or leads, searching for them individually can become time-consuming. By assigning each **Category** to a **Category group** in **Settings and maintenance**, you can simplify your searches dramatically.

With **Category group** available as a search criteria, you can quickly find all customers or leads belonging to a specific group - such as Customer, Potential customer, Partner, Lost, or Other - without needing to select every category one by one.
