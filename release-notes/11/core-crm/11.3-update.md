# Core CRM and Sales 11.3 update

## Selection - Board view for projects

The board view is a **visual layout for selections** that gives you a clear, process overview. Available for both projects and sales, it lets you drag and drop cards between stages, quickly edit records, and track progress at a glance - whether you're working on your own or as part of a team.

This view helps improve project visibility, saves time spent searching for information, and streamlines decision-making by keeping all the key details in one place.

## Selection - Preview card in board view

When working with board view in a selection, you often need a bit more detail. The **Preview** in the side panel makes this quick and easy.

Simply click on any card in your board view, and all information about that sale or project will be displayed in the side panel.

## Notification - New company/contact assigned

Keeping track of new customers and contacts is easy with notifications for newly assigned companies or contacts. You'll be instantly alerted whenever ownership changes, so you can follow up without delay.

Make sure your notification settings are up to date so you never miss an important update.

## Company/Contact - Keep Our contact empty

When working with new leads, it's not always obvious who to select as the "Our contact" user. You can create a new company or contact with this field left empty, while still being able to add all other relevant details. This makes lead management much easier.

You can also search for all companies and contacts where no **Our contact** has been selected.

> [!NOTE]
> When **Our contact** are empty the companies and contacts are shown as data owned by **Other associates**. Make sure the correct **data rights** are set for these sections/data objects in [Settings and maintenance > Roles][2].

## Dashboard - Copy dashboard link

When you find a dashboard that really works, you may want to share it with a colleague. To do this, simply open the **Task** menu, select **Copy dashboard link**, and send the link to your colleague.

Just remember: your colleague must also have access to the dashboard. You can check the owner and visible for in the dashboard details.

## Side panel - Preview email with attachments, recipients and reply/forward

Working with emails is part of everyday work. With the Preview option in the side panel, you can quickly access attachments, see the recipients and perform key tasks such as reply and forward - all directly from the preview panel.

To use it, simply select **Preview** in the side panel, click on an email, and choose the action you need.
