# Core CRM and Sales 11.3 update

## Selection - Board view for projects

The Board view is a **visual layout for selections** that gives you a clear, pipeline-style overview. Available for both projects (and sales), it lets you drag and drop items between stages, quickly edit records, and track progress at a glance - whether you’re working on your own or as part of a team.

This view helps improve project visibility, saves time spent searching for information, and streamlines decision-making by keeping all the key details in one place.

## Selection - Preview of board item

When working with Board view in a selection, you often need a bit more detail. The **Preview** in the Side panel makes this quick and easy.

Simply click on any item in your Board view, and all the information about that sale or project will be displayed in the Side panel preview.

## Notification - New company/contact assigned

Staying on top of new customers and contacts doesn’t have to be hard work. With notifications for newly assigned companies or contacts, you’ll instantly be alerted whenever ownership changes.

To ensure you never miss an update, check that your notification settings are up to date.

## Company/Contact - Keep Our contact empty

Mulighet for å søke etter our contact med tom info

> [!NOTE]
> These new companies and contacts without an Our contact will be grouped with data rights like Other associates, so make sure that you have correct data rights on this section in Settings and maintenance | Roles.

PS! Husk på at disse kontakter og firmaer havner i Other group på roller/funksjonelle rettigheter. Så dersom ingen har rettigheter for Other, da bør man endre dette.
