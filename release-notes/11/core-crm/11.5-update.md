# Core CRM and Sales 11.5 update

## Selection - Board view Setting for displaying days

Sale date badge: decides what the number in the grey badge displayed behind the sale date field means. Two possibilities:

**Days in stage**: shows number of days the sale has been in this stage. Should calculate the total number even if the sale has been visiting other stages since registration. Tooltip: total number of days in this stage.

**Days since registered**: shows number of days since the sale was first registered. Tooltip: number of days since registered.
