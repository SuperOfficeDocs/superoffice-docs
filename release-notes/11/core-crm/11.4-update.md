# Core CRM and Sales 11.4 update

## Selection - Board view for requests

Using Board view for requests gives you a clear visual overview grouped by status, request type, priority, or owner. You can organise your work the way you prefer - drag and drop requests between columns and see progress at a glance, in a way a list view cannot provide.

You can also preview and edit requests directly in the Board view, making it easy to send an internal message or reply to the customer without leaving the view.
