# Core CRM and Sales 11.10 update

## Dashboards – Visualising time spent in each Sales stage

The dashboards include measurement options that make it easier to analyse how long sales remain in each stage of the sales process.

* Measure of: Days in stage is available when selecting Average, Min, or Max in the Measure drop‑down.
* Group by stage: You can group results by Sale stage to better understand pipeline flow.
* Stacked by - Field: The visualization can be stacked by Days in stage, Owner, Owner group, Sale type, and more.

These capabilities provide clearer insight into stage duration, help identify bottlenecks, and support more data‑driven pipeline management.

## Notifications for re‑assigned follow‑ups

The system sends notifications for all re‑assigned follow‑ups, regardless of follow‑up type, ensuring better visibility and follow‑through when task ownership changes.

* Notifications are sent for all re‑assigned follow‑ups, regardless of follow‑up type.
* The system will generate notifications for re‑assignments with dates up to 30 days back in time, ensuring no updates are missed.

This approach makes follow‑up management more reliable, reduces the risk of overlooked tasks, and ensures users stay informed whenever ownership changes.
