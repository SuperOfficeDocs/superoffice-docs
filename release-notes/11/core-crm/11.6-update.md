# Core CRM and Sales 11.5 update

## Selection - Board view for company and contact

Want an overview of companies and contacts grouped by Lead status, Category, or Our contact? Simply create your selection of company and/or contacts and view it with board view.

Use the board view for **company** selections to get quick overview of the customer portfolio, or use the board view for **contact** selections to work with and follow up on leads.

> [!TIP]
> Swop between the settings to view the board for contact or company in **View entity** setting, to get the overview that works best for you.
