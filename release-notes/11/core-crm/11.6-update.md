# Core CRM and Sales 11.6 update

## Contact - Lead status list connected to the Category

When working with leads, the **Lead status** field is a valuable tool for organising and tracking progress. It becomes especially useful in the **Board view** of a contact selection, where you can easily drag and drop contacts between columns to update their status.

Make sure your Lead status list includes the correct values. You can edit the list items in **Settings and maintenance**.

## Selection - Board view for company and contact

Get a clear overview of your companies or contacts grouped by **Lead status**, **Category**, or **Our contact**. Create a company or contact selection and open it in **Board view** to visualise and manage your data more effectively.

Use the board view for **company selections**to see your customer portfolio at a glance, or use **contact selections** to follow up on leads and track progress.

> [!TIP]
> Switch between company and contact boards in the **View entity** setting to find the overview that that suits your workflow best.

## Search criteria - Lead creation and first touch on companies and contacts

You can access lead-related criteria under **Lead** in both the Company and Contact groupings. The **lead source** and **first touch** data help you analyse lead origins and are especially useful when creating **Dashboard tiles**.

This data is stored under the **Legal basis** section on the contact card.

> [!NOTE]
> First touch source, lead creation source and company source are only tracked for new contacts and companies that do not already exist in your SuperOffice CRM.

## Dashboard - Tiles for leads information

To understand where your leads come from, use the dedicated **Lead** tiles available under **Contact**:

* Funnel - Lead qualification funnel
* Pie - New leads by campaign YTD
* Pie - New leads by first touch source YTD
* Pie - New leads by lead creation source YTD
* Pie - New leads from chats YTD
