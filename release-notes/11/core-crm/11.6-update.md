# Core CRM and Sales 11.5 update

## Selection of sales - Board view Setting for displaying days

You can do a lot in the **Board view setting** to make the board work better for you.

In the **Settings** for board view for sale selections, you can select two different options for the **sale date badge**, the number in the grey badge displayed behind the sale date on the card:

* **Days in stage**: shows the total number of days the sale has been in this stage.

* **Days since registered** (default setting): shows number of days since the sale was first registered.

> [!TIP]
> Use the checkbox **Save settings for all users viewing this board** to apply your fine-tuning to everyone. This ensures that all users of the selection see the same customised board settings.
