# Core CRM and Sales 11.6 update

## Selection - Board view for company and contact

Want an overview of your companies or contacts grouped by **Lead status**, **Category**, or **Our contact**?
Simply create a selection of companies and/or contacts and open it in **Board view**.

Use the board view for **company selections** to get a quick overview of your customer portfolio, or use contact selections to manage and follow up on leads more effectively.

> [!TIP]
> Switch between company and contact boards in the **View entity** setting to find the overview that works best for you.

## Search criteria - Lead creation and first touch on companies and contacts

You have access to different criteria in the grouping for Lead under both Company and Contact. The lead source and first touch information is very useful to get an overview of, especially when creating tiles in Dashboard.

The lead source and first touch information are stored under Legal basis of the contact.

> [!NOTE]
> First touch source, lead creation source and company source are only tracked for new contacts and companies that does not already exist in your SuperOffice CRM.

## Dashboard - Tiles for leads information

To be able to see where the lead comes from, it is a great opportunity to use the different tiles for lead under **Contact**:
