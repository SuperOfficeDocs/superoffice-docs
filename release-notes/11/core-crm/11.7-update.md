# Core CRM and Sales 11.7 update

## Dashboard - Quick filter in dashboard

Quick filter allows users to apply flexible filtering options across various data tiles. This minimizes the need to create separate dashboards for data that you would like to visualize, instead quickly adjust the views without navigating away from the current dashboard. All list and date fields are available to use as quick filters.

The dashboard owner - as well as dashboard administrators - can add the desired quick filters. Individual users can then adjust these quick filters to tailor the tiles content to their own needs.

## Dashboard - Load a tile again on time outs

Tiles containing large amounts of data can sometimes time out. If this happens, you can reload just that tile by clicking the reload button.

This way, you don’t need to reload the entire dashboard—avoiding the risk of encountering the same issue again.
