# Core CRM and Sales 11.7 update

## Dashboard - Quick filter in dashboard

Quick filter allows users to apply flexible filtering options across various data tiles. This minimizes the need to create separate dashboards for data that you would like to visualize, instead quickly adjust the views without navigating away from the current dashboard. All list and date fields are available to use as quick filters.

The dashboard owner - as well as dashboard administrators - can add the desired quick filters. Individual users can then adjust these quick filters to tailor the tiles content to their own needs.

## Dashboard - Load a tile again on time outs

Tiles containing large amounts of data can sometimes time out. If this happens, you can reload just that tile by clicking the reload button.

This way, you don’t need to reload the entire dashboard—avoiding the risk of encountering the same issue again.

---

Tiles that contains a lot of data will sometimes time out, due to too much data. If you still want to load and see the tile content, you can click the reload button for just that tile.

Like that you do not need to load the whole dashboard again, and maybe get the same issue.

## Selection of sales - Board view Setting for displaying days

You can do a lot in the **Board view setting** to make the board work better for you.

In the **Settings** for board view for sale selections, you can select two different options for the **sale date badge**, the number in the grey badge displayed behind the sale date on the card:

* **Days in stage**: shows the total number of days the sale has been in this stage.

* **Days since registered** (default setting): shows number of days since the sale was first registered.

> [!TIP]
> Use the checkbox **Save settings for all users viewing this board** to apply your fine-tuning to everyone. This ensures that all users of the selection see the same customised board settings.

## Selection - Board view grouped by Our contacts to prevent Lost leads

To ensure that no leads fall through the cracks, it’s essential to quickly identify which marketing qualified leads have not yet been assigned to a sales representative. The **"No selection"** column in board view (when grouped by **Our contacts**) highlights companies that haven’t been assigned an owner and are not currently being followed up by sales.

Go to your selection of contacts/companies, select Board view and the make sure you have grouped your board view by **Our contacts**, and you will see the No selection column. This allows you to quickly drag and drop unassigned contacts/companies to the appropriate owner.

It’s a simple and efficient way to distribute new leads and keep your pipeline moving smoothly.

> [!TIP]
> If you only see the **No selection** column, you need to change the owner manually by edit the card and select correct Our contact. After that you will see more columns in your board view and can easily drag-and-drop from the No selection column.

## Selection of sales - Board view Setting for displaying days in stage

In board view for sale selections grouped by stage, you see number of days the sale have been in that stage. This is prevent too slow moving forward.

## Company view - The default fields contains Priority and Our service contact

The default view for Company will contain Priority and Our service contact, so it's easy for a user to see this information. Those fields are important for all users when your company use Service as your ticket system. This is also default when your company do not have access to Screen designer.
