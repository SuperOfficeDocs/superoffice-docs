# Core CRM and Sales 11.7 update

## Dashboard - Valuable asset to your work

In your busy everyday working life, it’s very helpful to get a quick summary of the things that are most important for you to focus on, whether it’s sales, activities, or cases you have ongoing with your companies and contacts. With the Dashboard, you can create exactly the overview you need to stay ahead of all your tasks and deadlines.

Here is just a quick overview of what you can do to make your everyday life a little easier and less hectic. And most importantly - it might even help you avoid forgetting something important.

### Dashboard - Quick filter in dashboard

Quick filter allows users to apply flexible filtering options across various data tiles. This minimizes the need to create separate dashboards for data that you would like to visualize, instead quickly adjust the views without navigating away from the current dashboard. All list and date fields are available to use as quick filters.

The dashboard owner - as well as dashboard administrators - can add the desired quick filters. Individual users can then adjust these quick filters to tailor the tiles content to their own needs.

### Dashboard - Load a tile again on time outs

Loading a large dashboard with tiles based on complex datasets can put a strain on the system. Instead of making you wait for everything to load, the system introduces timeouts on the heaviest tiles—giving you less waiting time and more flexibility to review the rest of your dashboard.

Tiles that contain a lot of data may time out if they take longer than 15 seconds to load. If you still want to view the content of a timed-out tile, simply click the reload button for that specific tile. If the tile has not loaded within 5 minutes, it will time out again.

Timeouts may also occur in the Layout tab when editing a tile, as well as in the Chart tab in Selections. In these cases too, you can reload the tile whenever needed.

> [!NOTE]
> If certain tiles consistently time out, consider adjusting the dataset to improve loading performance.

## Selection of companies/contacts - Board view grouped by Our contacts to prevent Lost leads

To ensure that no leads fall through the cracks, it’s essential to quickly identify which marketing qualified leads have not yet been assigned to a sales representative. The **"No selection"** grouping in board view (when grouped by **Our contacts**) highlights companies that haven’t been assigned an owner and are not currently being followed up by sales.

Go to your selection of contacts/companies, select Board view and make sure you have grouped your board view by **Our contacts**, and you will see the No selection column. This allows you to quickly drag and drop unassigned contacts/companies to the appropriate owner.

It’s a simple and efficient way to distribute new leads and keep your pipeline moving smoothly.

> [!TIP]
> Board view will only group on associates specified as **Our contact** within your selection data. If you cannot see the associate you want to drag-and-drop a company/contact to, open the card for **edit** and set the correct **Our contact** value. After saving, that associate will appear as its own group. If there are no unassigned companies/contacts in your selection, the No selection column will not be shown.

## Selection of sales - Board view Setting for displaying days in stage

You can do a lot in the **Board view setting** to make the board work better for you.

In the **Settings** for board view for sale selections, you can select two different options for the **sale date badge**, the number in the grey badge displayed behind the sale date on the card:

* **Days in stage**: shows the total number of days the sale has been in this stage. This is prevent too slow moving forward.

* **Days since registered** (default setting): shows number of days since the sale was first registered.

> [!TIP]
> Use the checkbox **Save settings for all users viewing this board** to apply your fine-tuning to everyone. This ensures that all users of the selection see the same customised board settings.
