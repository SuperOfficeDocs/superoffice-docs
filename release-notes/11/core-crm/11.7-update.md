# Core CRM and Sales 11.7 update

## Dashboard - Quick filter in dashboard

Quick filter allows users to apply flexible filtering options across various data tiles. This minimizes the need to create separate dashboards for data that you would like to visualize, instead quickly adjust the views without navigating away from the current dashboard. All list and date fields are available to use as quick filters.

The dashboard owner - as well as dashboard administrators - can add the desired quick filters. Individual users can then adjust these quick filters to tailor the tiles content to their own needs.

## Dashboard - Load a tile again on time outs

Loading a large dashboard with tiles based on complex datasets can put a strain on the system. Instead of making you wait for everything to load, the system introduces timeouts on the heaviest tiles—giving you less waiting time and more flexibility to review the rest of your dashboard.

Tiles that contain a lot of data may time out if they take longer than 15 seconds to load. If you still want to view the content of a timed-out tile, simply click the reload button for that specific tile. If the tile has not loaded within 5 minutes, it will time out again.

Timeouts may also occur in the Layout tab when editing a tile, as well as in the Chart tab in Selections. In these cases too, you can reload the tile whenever needed.

> [!NOTE]
> If certain tiles consistently time out, consider adjusting the dataset to improve loading performance.

Original text:

To load a large dashboard with tiles with complicated datasets might strain the system a little too much, and the system will make you wait some time, time you might not have. Wit ha time out on the most complicated tiles, gives you less time to wait, and more time to check out the different tiles in your dashboard.

Tiles that contains a lot of data will sometimes time out, due to too much data (the time out are set to 15 sec). If you still want to load and see the tile content, you can click the reload button for just that tile. If the tile still haven't loaded in 5 min, the loading will time out again.

The time out also happens in the Layout tab on Edit tile and the Chart section tab in Selections, but you still can load the tile again if it's important.

> [!NOTE]
> If some tiles always time out, you should reconsider to change the dataset to get a quicker loading time.

## Selection - Board view grouped by Our contacts to prevent Lost leads

To ensure that no leads fall through the cracks, it’s essential to quickly identify which marketing qualified leads have not yet been assigned to a sales representative. The **"No selection"** column in board view (when grouped by **Our contacts**) highlights companies that haven’t been assigned an owner and are not currently being followed up by sales.

Go to your selection of contacts/companies, select Board view and the make sure you have grouped your board view by **Our contacts**, and you will see the No selection column. This allows you to quickly drag and drop unassigned contacts/companies to the appropriate owner.

It’s a simple and efficient way to distribute new leads and keep your pipeline moving smoothly.

> [!TIP]
> If you only see the **No selection** column, you need to change the owner manually by edit the card and select correct Our contact. After that you will see more columns in your board view and can easily drag-and-drop from the No selection column.

## Selection of sales - Board view Setting for displaying days in stage

You can do a lot in the **Board view setting** to make the board work better for you.

In the **Settings** for board view for sale selections, you can select two different options for the **sale date badge**, the number in the grey badge displayed behind the sale date on the card:

* **Days in stage**: shows the total number of days the sale has been in this stage. This is prevent too slow moving forward.

* **Days since registered** (default setting): shows number of days since the sale was first registered.

> [!TIP]
> Use the checkbox **Save settings for all users viewing this board** to apply your fine-tuning to everyone. This ensures that all users of the selection see the same customised board settings.

## Company view - The default fields contains Priority and Our service contact

The default view for Company will contain Priority and Our service contact, so it's easy for a user to see this information. Those fields are important for all users when your company use Service as your ticket system. This is also default when your company do not have access to Screen designer.
