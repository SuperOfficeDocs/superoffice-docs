# Core CRM and Sales 11.7 update

## Dashboard - Quick filter in dashboard

Quick filter allows users to apply flexible filtering options across various data tiles. This minimizes the need to create separate dashboards for data that you would like to visualize, instead quickly adjust the views without navigating away from the current dashboard. All list and date fields are available to use as quick filters.

The dashboard owner - as well as dashboard administrators - can add the desired quick filters. Individual users can then adjust these quick filters to tailor the tiles content to their own needs.

## Dashboard - Load a tile again on time outs

Tiles containing large amounts of data can sometimes time out. If this happens, you can reload just that tile by clicking the reload button.

This way, you don’t need to reload the entire dashboard—avoiding the risk of encountering the same issue again.

Tiles that contains a lot of data will sometimes time out, due to too much data. If you still want to load and see the tile content, you can click the reload button for just that tile.

Like that you do not need to load the whole dashboard again, and maybe get the same issue.

## Selection of sales - Board view Setting for displaying days

You can do a lot in the **Board view setting** to make the board work better for you.

In the **Settings** for board view for sale selections, you can select two different options for the **sale date badge**, the number in the grey badge displayed behind the sale date on the card:

* **Days in stage**: shows the total number of days the sale has been in this stage.

* **Days since registered** (default setting): shows number of days since the sale was first registered.

> Use the checkbox **Save settings for all users viewing this board** to apply your fine-tuning to everyone. This ensures that all users of the selection see the same customised board settings.
