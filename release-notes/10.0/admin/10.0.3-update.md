# Settings and maintenance 10.0.3 update

## Screen designer – settings on fields

Setting up the different layouts with the different fields is a detailed job. To get the best result, you want to have some fields left-aligned and some fields right -aligned. Especially number fields are very neat to have right-aligned, so it's easier to compare the different numbers with each other.

Select the field and choose the correct settings for the field, both for font and alignment.

## Screen designer – info for last published by and date

The layout can be drafted and published by multiple users.

To see the date on **Last published** and the user that did it, is very good indication to see if the latest changes have been published or not.

## Screen designer – custom buttons with tooltip

Creating a user-defined button, it's a good idea to not have a very long name on the button.

To give your users knowledge about what will happen pushing this button, add a good tooltip like a description for the button.

## CRMScript – intellisense experience

Intellisense has a more unified and informative look and feel, making it clear what is the expected return type and parameters.
