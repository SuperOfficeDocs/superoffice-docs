# Settings and maintenance 10.0.2 update

## Screen designer – Use ERP fields as a block

On the **Screen designer** you can also show the ERP fields on the front page, not only on the **ERP** tab.

With that option, if ERP is important for your company, or for a specific user group, you can choose to get the ERP information on the first page on the **Company** and/or the **Contact** card.

You cannot choose what fields to show: you get all the ERP fields as a block or none at all, so make sure you have enough room for them.
