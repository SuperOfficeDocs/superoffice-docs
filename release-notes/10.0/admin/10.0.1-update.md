# Settings and maintenance 10.0.1 update

## Screen designer – New functionality

You can **configure** the **Company** and **Contact** main cards just the way you want them in the **Screen designer**. You can:

* Remove the fields not used.
* Show the fields most used on the first page.
* Group fields with headings and add tabs and buttons just the way you want them.

Add a new layout for specific user groups. Like that, your different user groups can have different layouts. Set up the layout with the fields that are most valuable for the different user groups.

All fields, both standard, and user-defined fields are available in the **Fields** section. Under Elements, you have Label, Divider, Link, and Button.
