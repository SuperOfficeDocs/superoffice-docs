# SuperOffice Core CRM 10.0.2 update

## Dashboards – Duplicate tile within a dashboard

If you are happy with a specific tile in a dashboard, and you want to reuse most of the settings, you can select the button **Duplicate tile** on the tile and make the changes you like.

Like that you can reuse the settings of a tile. Change the dataset to show the same type of data for example for another group, or use a different group the tile layout.

## Dashboards – Hide currency info

On some tiles, the currency takes up a lot of space. When you do not want to show the currency inside the tile, simply select **Hide** for the currency setting when editing the tile.

## Dashboards – Tiles for web panel and HTML text and images

You can add a web panel or HTML as a tile to your dashboard. That opens up a lot of possibilities, both to style it and to show information not just inside SuperOffice CRM.

### Web panel tile

You add a URL you want to show, and drag and drop the tile where you like on the dashboard.

### HTML tile

You can add text in all our languages, like an explanation to the dashboard or a tile. You have the same formatting option for text as you have for Chats and Forms.

## Dashboards – Old dashboard with read-mode on tile

On the old dashboard, you probably have some tiles you really would like to recreate in our new dashboard. To do so:

1. Select the old dashboard and the wanted tile.
2. Go to **Edit** and you have the read mode of the tile to see the different settings and selections you have used for the tile.
3. With that information, you can now create a new tile in the new dashboard.

> [!TIP]
> You can take a screen dump to easier compare settings for the new tile in the new dashboard and the screen dump from the old dashboard.
