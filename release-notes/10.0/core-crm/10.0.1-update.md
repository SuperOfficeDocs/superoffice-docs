# SuperOffice Core CRM 10.0.1 update

## Dashboards – Improved functionality

![Dashboards -screenshot][img1]

The dashboard can have as many **tiles** as you like or as many as needed. If adding too many you will get a scrollbar.

You can choose how many **columns** a dashboard should contain and what type of **theme** it can have.

As an administrator you can create and **pin dashboards** to different users and user groups. And you can also set **visible for** to users and user groups, so that a user not interested in very specialized dashboard will not be able to search for them.

You can set a dashboard as favorite to always show it as a tab in your own dashboard view.

Drag and drop tiles into the grid and change the size to the exact wanted view. The **library** shows all available tiles. You can also choose a chart from a dynamic **selection**.

Change the **dataset** behind the tile, just use criteria to get the exact data you want.

> [!NOTE]
> This will change it **only on this tile**, not on existing dashboards or new ones.

Change the layout of the tile, so it explains the data as good as possible.

> [!NOTE]
> If the **Layout** tab is disabled, this means you do not have sufficient user rights. Contact your administrator to get the needed user plan.

You can **search** for dashboards that either you or your colleagues have made.

> [!NOTE]
> Your favorites dashboard will always be shown as a tab in your dashboard view.

You still have access to your **old dashboards** so you can recreate them in the new layout. You cannot edit them anymore, only view.
