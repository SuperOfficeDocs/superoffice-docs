# SuperOffice Core CRM 10.0.6 update

## Dashboards – Line charts with spline/soft line

On **charts** that include a **line**, you can choose the line type:

* Line
* Soft line

The **soft line** (spline) will show the line with a softer change, compared to the line option.

**Graph with standard line:**

## Languages – 5 new UI languages on all modules

There are five new languages to choose from in the user interface:

| Language | SO code | LCID string |
|---|---|---|
| Chinese simplified | CN | zh-cn |
| German - Swiss | CH | de-ch |
| Korean|  KO | ko-kr |
| Portuguese - Brazil | BR | pt-br |
| Vietnamese | VI | vi-vn |

* The help for German – Swiss will go to the German help.
* The help for the other languages will go to the default English help.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier, Chinese was supported but only in the Sales module. Now it is available also in Marketing, Service, Settings and maintenance, Mobile CRM, Outlook Mail link, Gmail link, and SuperOffice for Outlook.
