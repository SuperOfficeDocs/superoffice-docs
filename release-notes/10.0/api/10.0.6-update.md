# SuperOffice API 10.0.6 update

## API – SuperOffice.WebApi Agent with better testability

When using our [WebAPI][1] it's important to be able to test your use of it.

## API – TicketAgent new method

The [Ticket][3] and [TicketMessage][2] POST REST APIs have a new parameter to send notifications or not. Defaults to not. This will not affect integrations.

New **TicketAgent** methods:

* SaveTicketEntityWithNotify
* SaveTicketMessageEntityWithNotify

## Password validation

Password validation towards password policy has been added for change of password through the API. See also [updates to password dialog][4].
