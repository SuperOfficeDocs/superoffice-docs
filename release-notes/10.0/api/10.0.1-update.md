# SuperOffice API 10.0.1 update

## API – New license structure

In SuperOffice 10, there is a new user plan structure. Due to the license changes on users, the API is also changed to support all the different licenses, and so on.

If your app checks for or requires a specific license, it must take the SuperOffice 10 license scheme into account.
