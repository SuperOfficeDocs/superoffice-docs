# SuperOffice API 10.0.5 update

## API – Webhooks sent for Bulk update changes

Webhooks are a means to broadcast events that happen inside SuperOffice as they occur. A webhook payload includes information that describes what has changed and is broadcast to all applications that have subscribed to a corresponding event.

This change fixed a bug and now webhooks are sent by actions performed by Bulk updates.
