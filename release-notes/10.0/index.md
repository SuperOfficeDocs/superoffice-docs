In addition, the new Screen designer feature allows you to configure your main standard screens as well as design the layout of your More tabs.

With the new product packaging, new features, technological and feature improvements, and introducing new add-ons, SuperOffice 10 is a solution available today and created for tomorrow’s CRM needs.

After your upgrade to SuperOffice 10, there are some changes to note:

* The sorting and placing of your user-defined fields will change and automatically presents themselves into two columns in the More tab of your solution.

* If you want to revert to the layout used to be, we suggest that you document today's layout. The easiest way is to take a picture of the More tab.
