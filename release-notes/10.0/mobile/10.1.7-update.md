# SuperOffice Mobile CRM 10.1.7 update

## Mobile CRM – Show stop on Company

The **stop** sign on **Company** can be used for a lot of things. The most common way to use it is if there are issues with payment, the customer is in the progress of canceling their engagement or the company needs to have some special treatment that you, as a user, need to be aware of.

When a company is marked with the **Stop** sign, it’s useful to see it at once, instead of scrolling down the details list to see the check box on/off. The stop sign in the header will give you an instant warning before you do anything with the company.

## Mobile CRM – Add multiple images to a request

When replying to a request, you can add an image to the comment. It's pretty nice to be able to add multiple images in one go.

1. Go to the Menu.

2. Select either **Add image from gallery** or **Add image from camera**.
