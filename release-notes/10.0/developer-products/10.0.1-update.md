# Developer products 10.0.1 update

## AI Services – New functionality

Artificial Intelligence Services contain different areas:

* [Text analysis][1] on incoming requests.
* [Categorization][2] where the service tries to find the best category for requests.
* [Chatbot][3] for a Chat channel, where the message on the chat is passed on to a script for processing.
