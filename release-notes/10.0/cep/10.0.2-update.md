## Chat â€“ Warning on new chat message

When you are working with chats, you sometimes have to wait for the answer from the other part. And when you do, you probably want to do other stuff. But you still want to get notified when you do get an answer.

* Warning on new chat
* Manager warning on new chat
* Warning on new chat message
* Manager warning on new chat message
