# Customer Engagement Platform 10.0.3 update

## Chat – customer can create request if long queue

Using chat is a short way to get answers to your questions. When no agents are available, for example outside office hours or when there is a long queue, it's a great way to keep the customers happy by allowing them to create a requests instead.

The customer place whatever question they have, send the request, and can sit back and wait for an answer as soon as an agent are available and can answer the request.
