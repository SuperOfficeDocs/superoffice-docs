# Customer Engagement Platform 10.0.4 update

## Chat – When in queue keep writing a message

Have you thought about when trying to chat with a company and then not being able to start writing your questions before someone picks up your chat.

You can send more details in the chat before an agent starts chatting with you. Actually, you can send as many messages as you like.

Also remember, that as a customer, you can also create a request from the lobby and then leave the chat. This is very neat when suddenly something happens and you need to go.

The setting for this is in the Offline form. Select **Enable request submission in queue** to turn it on.
